	Abstract = {This paper reviews literature, current concepts and approaches in computational anatomy (CA). The model of CA is a Grenander deformable template, an orbit generated from a template under groups of diffeomorphisms. The metric space of all anatomical images is constructed from the geodesic connecting one anatomical structure to another in the orbit. The variational problems specifying these metrics are reviewed along with their associated Euler-Lagrange equations. The Euler equations of motion derived by Arnold for the geodesics in the group of divergence-free volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of incompressible fluids are generalized for the larger group of diffeomorphisms used in CA with nonconstant Jacobians. Metrics that accommodate photometric variation are described extending the anatomical model to incorporate the construction of neoplasm. Metrics on landmarked shapes are reviewed as well as Joshi's diffeomorphism metrics, Bookstein's thin-plate spline approximate-metrics, and Kendall's affine invariant metrics. We conclude by showing recent experimental results from the Toga & Thompson group in growth, the Van Essen group in macaque and human cortex mapping, and the Csernansky group in hippocampus mapping for neuropsychiatric studies in aging and schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {We propose an efficient non-parametric diffeomorphic image registration algorithm based on Thirion's demons algorithm. In the first part of this paper, we show that Thirion's demons algorithm can be seen as an optimization procedure on the entire space of displacement fields. We provide strong theoretical roots to the different variants of Thirion's demons algorithm. This analysis predicts a theoretical advantage for the symmetric forces variant of the demons algorithm. We show on controlled experiments that this advantage is confirmed in practice and yields a faster convergence. In the second part of this paper, we adapt the optimization procedure underlying the demons algorithm to a space of diffeomorphic transformations. In contrast to many diffeomorphic registration algorithms, our solution is computationally efficient since in practice it only replaces an addition of displacement fields by a few compositions. Our experiments show that in addition to being diffeomorphic, our algorithm provides results that are similar to the ones from the demons algorithm but with transformations that are much smoother and closer to the gold standard, available in controlled experiments, in terms of Jacobians.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure postmortem burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology and to identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.
METHODS: In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD-TDP = 13, FTLD-Tau = 14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of postmortem pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to 8 cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to antemortem structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.
RESULTS: Postmortem cortical pathology was left-lateralized in both FTLD-TDP (beta = -0.15, standard error [SE] = 0.05, p = 0.007) and FTLD-Tau (beta = -0.09, SE = 0.04, p = 0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta = -8.18, SE = 3.22, p = 0.015). Among 5 core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD-TDP, which was greater than in FTLD-Tau (F = 47.07, df = 1,17, p < 0.001), and in left midfrontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD-Tau, which was greater than in FTLD-TDP (F = 19.34, df = 1,16, p < 0.001). Postmortem pathology was inversely associated with antemortem magnetic resonance imaging cortical thickness (beta = -0.04, SE = 0.01, p = 0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single-word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t = -3.72, df = 10.72, p = 0.004) and nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t = -3.62, df = 12.00, p = 0.004) among the 5 core pathology regions.
INTERPRETATION: In PPA, FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left-lateralized postmortem pathology that relate to antemortem structural imaging and distinct language deficits. Although other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve antemortem diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.

@article{giannini17,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether logopenic features of phonologic loop dysfunction reflect Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology in primary progressive aphasia (PPA).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of 34 patients with PPA with available autopsy tissue. We compared baseline and longitudinal clinical features in patients with primary AD neuropathology to those with primary non-AD pathologies. We analyzed regional neuroanatomic disease burden in pathology-defined groups using postmortem neuropathologic data.
RESULTS: A total of 19/34 patients had primary AD pathology and 15/34 had non-AD pathology (13 frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 2 Lewy body disease). A total of 16/19 (84%) patients with AD had a logopenic spectrum phenotype; 5 met published criteria for the logopenic variant (lvPPA), 8 had additional grammatical or semantic deficits (lvPPA+), and 3 had relatively preserved sentence repetition (lvPPA-). Sentence repetition was impaired in 68% of patients with PPA with AD pathology; forward digit span (DF) was impaired in 90%, substantially higher than in non-AD PPA (33%, p < 0.01). Lexical retrieval difficulty was common in all patients with PPA and did not discriminate between groups. Compared to non-AD, PPA with AD pathology had elevated microscopic neurodegenerative pathology in the superior/midtemporal gyrus, angular gyrus, and midfrontal cortex (p < 0.01). Low DF scores correlated with high microscopic pathologic burden in superior/midtemporal and angular gyri (p ≤ 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Phonologic loop dysfunction is a central feature of AD-associated PPA and specifically correlates with temporoparietal neurodegeneration. Quantitative measures of phonologic loop function, combined with modified clinical lvPPA criteria, may help discriminate AD-associated PPA.},

	Abstract = {Antemortem behavioural and anatomic abnormalities have largely been associated with right hemisphere disease in behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia, but post-mortem neuropathological examination of bilateral hemispheres remains to be defined. Here we measured the severity of post-mortem pathology in both grey and white matter using a validated digital image analysis method in four cortical regions sampled from each hemisphere in 26 patients with behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia, including those with frontotemporal degeneration (i.e. tau = 9, TDP-43 = 14, or FUS = 1 proteinopathy) or Alzheimer's pathology (n = 2). We calculated an asymmetry index based on the difference in measured pathology from each left-right sample pair. Analysis of the absolute value of the asymmetry index (i.e. degree of asymmetry independent of direction) revealed asymmetric pathology for both grey and white matter in all four regions sampled in frontototemporal degeneration patients with tau or TDP-43 pathology (P ≤ 0.01). Direct interhemispheric comparisons of regional pathology measurements within-subjects in the combined tauopathy and TDP-43 proteinopathy group found higher pathology in the right orbitofrontal grey matter compared to the left (P < 0.01) and increased pathology in ventrolateral temporal lobe grey matter of the left hemisphere compared to the right (P < 0.02). Preliminary group-wise comparisons between tauopathy and TDP-43 proteinopathy groups found differences in patterns of interhemispheric burden of grey and white matter regional pathology, with greater relative white matter pathology in tauopathies. To test the association of pathology measurement with ante-mortem observations, we performed exploratory analyses in the subset of patients with imaging data (n = 15) and found a direct association for increasing pathologic burden with decreasing cortical thickness in frontotemporal regions on ante-mortem imaging in tauopathy (P = 0.001) and a trend for TDP-43 proteinopathy (P = 0.06). Exploratory clinicopathological correlations demonstrated an association of socially-inappropriate behaviours with asymmetric right orbitofrontal grey matter pathology, and reduced semantically-guided category naming fluency was associated asymmetric white matter pathology in the left ventrolateral temporal region. We conclude that pathologic disease burden is distributed asymmetrically in behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia, although not universally in the right hemisphere, and this asymmetry contributes to the clinical heterogeneity of the disorder. The basis for this asymmetric profile is enigmatic but may reflect distinct species or strains of tau and TDP-43 pathologies with propensities to spread by distinct cell- and region-specific mechanisms. Patterns of region-specific pathology in the right hemisphere as well as the left hemisphere may play a role in antemortem clinical observations, and these observations may contribute to antemortem identification of molecular pathology in frontotemporal degeneration.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize sequential patterns of regional neuropathology and clinical symptoms in a well-characterized cohort of 21 patients with autopsy-confirmed Pick disease.
METHODS: Detailed neuropathological examination using 70μm and traditional 6μm sections was performed using thioflavin-S staining and immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated tau, 3R and 4R tau isoforms, ubiquitin, and C-terminally truncated tau. Patterns of regional tau deposition were correlated with clinical data. In a subset of cases (n = 5), converging evidence was obtained using antemortem neuroimaging measures of gray and white matter integrity.
RESULTS: Four sequential patterns of pathological tau deposition were identified starting in frontotemporal limbic/paralimbic and neocortical regions (phase I). Sequential involvement was seen in subcortical structures, including basal ganglia, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei (phase II), followed by primary motor cortex and precerebellar nuclei (phase III) and finally visual cortex in the most severe (phase IV) cases. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia was the predominant clinical phenotype (18 of 21), but all patients eventually developed a social comportment disorder. Pathological tau phases reflected the evolution of clinical symptoms and degeneration on serial antemortem neuroimaging, directly correlated with disease duration and inversely correlated with brain weight at autopsy. The majority of neuronal and glial tau inclusions were 3R tau-positive and 4R tau-negative in sporadic cases. There was a relative abundance of mature tau pathology markers in frontotemporal limbic/paralimbic regions compared to neocortical regions.
INTERPRETATION: Pick disease tau neuropathology may originate in limbic/paralimbic cortices. The patterns of tau pathology observed here provide novel insights into the natural history and biology of tau-mediated neurodegeneration.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We sought to assess the individual and combined contribution of limbic and neocortical α-synuclein, tau, and amyloid β (Aβ) to duration of illness in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).
METHODS: Quantitative digital pathology of limbic and neocortical α-synuclein, tau, and Aβ was assessed in 49 patients with clinically probable DLB. Regression modeling examined the unique and shared contribution of each pathology to the variance of illness duration.
RESULTS: Patients with diffuse Lewy body disease had more severe pathology of each type and a shorter duration of illness than individuals with transitional Lewy body disease. The three pathologies accounted for 25% of the total variance of duration of illness, with 19% accounted for by α-synuclein alone or in combination with tau and Aβ. When the diffuse Lewy body disease group was examined separately, α-synuclein deposition significantly exceeded that of tau and Aβ. In this model, 20% of 24% total variance in the model for duration of illness was accounted for independently by α-synuclein.
DISCUSSION: In DLB, α-synuclein is an important predictor of disease duration, both independently and synergistically with tau and Aβ.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative neuropathologic methods provide information that is important for both research and clinical applications. The technologic advancement of digital pathology and image analysis offers new solutions to enable valid quantification of pathologic severity that is reproducible between raters regardless of experience. Using an Aperio ScanScope XT and its accompanying image analysis software, we designed algorithms for quantitation of amyloid and tau pathologies on 65 β-amyloid (6F/3D antibody) and 48 phospho-tau (PHF-1)-immunostained sections of human temporal neocortex. Quantitative digital pathologic data were compared with manual pathology counts. There were excellent correlations between manually counted and digitally analyzed neuropathologic parameters (R² = 0.56-0.72). Data were highly reproducible among 3 participants with varying degrees of expertise in neuropathology (intraclass correlation coefficient values, >0.910). Digital quantification also provided additional parameters, including average plaque area, which shows statistically significant differences when samples are stratified according to apolipoprotein E allele status (average plaque area, 380.9 μm² in apolipoprotein E [Latin Small Letter Open E]4 carriers vs 274.4 μm² for noncarriers; p < 0.001). Thus, digital pathology offers a rigorous and reproducible method for quantifying Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes and may provide additional insights into morphologic characteristics that were previously more challenging to assess because of technical limitations.},

	Abstract = {Multiple different pathological protein aggregates are frequently seen in human postmortem brains and hence mixed pathology is common. Mixed dementia on the other hand is less frequent and neuropathologically should only be diagnosed if criteria for more than one full blown disease are met. We quantitatively measured the amount of hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated tau (HP-τ), amyloid-β protein (Aβ) and α-synuclein (α-syn) in cases that were neuropathologically diagnosed as mixed Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neocortical Lewy body disease (LBD) but clinically presented either as dementia due to AD or LBD, the latter including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Our study group consisted of 28 cases (mean age, 76.11 SE: $\pm$1.29 years; m:f, 17:11) of which 19 were neuropathologically diagnosed as mixed AD/DLB. Clinically, 8 mixed AD/DLB cases were diagnosed as AD (cAD), 8 as DLB (cDLB) and 3 as PDD (cPDD). In addition, we investigated cases that were both clinically and neuropathologically diagnosed as either AD (pure AD; n = 5) or DLB/neocortical LBD (pure DLB; n = 4). Sections from neocortical, limbic and subcortical areas were stained with antibodies against HP-τ, Aβ and α-syn. The area covered by immunopositivity was measured using image analysis. cAD cases had higher HP-τ loads than both cDLB and cPDD and the distribution of HP-τ in cAD was similar to the one observed in pure AD whilst cDLB showed comparatively less hippocampal HP-τ load. cPDD cases showed lower HP-τ and Aβ loads and higher α-syn loads. Here, we show that in neuropathologically mixed AD/DLB cases both the amount and the topographical distribution of pathological protein aggregates differed between distinct clinical phenotypes. Large-scale clinicopathological correlative studies using a quantitative methodology are warranted to further elucidate the neuropathological correlate of clinical symptoms in cases with mixed pathology.},

	Abstract = {Digital pathology is increasingly prominent in neurodegenerative disease research, but variability in immunohistochemical staining intensity between staining batches prevents large-scale comparative studies. Here we provide a statistically rigorous method to account for staining batch effects in a large sample of brain tissue with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-Tau, N = 39) or TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP, N = 53). We analyzed the relationship between duplicate measurements of digital pathology, i.e., percent area occupied by pathology (%AO) for grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), from two distinct staining batches. We found a significant difference in duplicate measurements from distinct staining batches in FTLD-Tau (mean difference: GM = 1.13 $\pm$ 0.44, WM = 1.28 $\pm$ 0.56; p < 0.001) and FTLD-TDP (GM = 0.95 $\pm$ 0.66, WM = 0.90 $\pm$ 0.77; p < 0.001), and these measurements were linearly related (R-squared [Rsq]: FTLD-Tau GM = 0.92, WM = 0.92; FTLD-TDP GM = 0.75, WM = 0.78; p < 0.001 all). We therefore used linear regression to transform %AO from distinct staining batches into equivalent values. Using a train-test set design, we examined transformation prerequisites (i.e., Rsq) from linear-modeling in training sets, and we applied equivalence factors (i.e., beta, intercept) to independent testing sets to determine transformation outcomes (i.e., intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]). First, random iterations (×100) of linear regression showed that smaller training sets (N = 12-24), feasible for prospective use, have acceptable transformation prerequisites (mean Rsq: FTLD-Tau ≥0.9; FTLD-TDP ≥0.7). When cross-validated on independent complementary testing sets, in FTLD-Tau, N = 12 training sets resulted in 100% of GM and WM transformations with optimal transformation outcomes (ICC ≥ 0.8), while in FTLD-TDP N = 24 training sets resulted in optimal ICC in testing sets (GM = 72%, WM = 98%). We therefore propose training sets of N = 12 in FTLD-Tau and N = 24 in FTLD-TDP for prospective transformations. Finally, the transformation enabled us to significantly reduce batch-related difference in duplicate measurements in FTLD-Tau (GM/WM: p < 0.001 both) and FTLD-TDP (GM/WM: p < 0.001 both), and to decrease the necessary sample size estimated in a power analysis in FTLD-Tau (GM:-40%; WM: -34%) and FTLD-TDP (GM: -20%; WM: -30%). Finally, we tested generalizability of our approach using a second, open-source, image analysis platform and found similar results. We concluded that a small sample of tissue stained in duplicate can be used to account for pre-analytical variability such as staining batch effects, thereby improving methods for future studies.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To use digital histology in a large autopsy cohort of Lewy body disorder (LBD) patients with dementia to test the hypotheses that co-occurring Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology impacts the anatomic distribution of α-synuclein (SYN) pathology and that co-occurring neocortical tau pathology in LBDs associates with worse cognitive performance and occurs in a pattern differing from AD.
METHODS: Fifty-five autopsy-confirmed LBD (Parkinson disease with dementia, n = 36; dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 19) patients and 25 AD patients were studied. LBD patients were categorized as having moderate/severe AD copathology (SYN + AD = 20) or little/no AD copathology (SYN-AD = 35). Digital measures of tau, β-amyloid (Aβ), and SYN histopathology in neocortical and subcortical/limbic regions were compared between groups and related to antemortem cognitive testing.
RESULTS: SYN burden was higher in SYN + AD than SYN-AD in each neocortical region (F1, 54 = 5.6-6.0, p < 0.02) but was equivalent in entorhinal cortex and putamen (F1, 43-49 = 0.7-1.7, p > 0.2). SYN + AD performed worse than SYN-AD on a temporal lobe-mediated naming task (t27 = 2.1, p = 0.04). Antemortem cognitive test scores inversely correlated with tau burden (r = -0.39 to -0.68, p < 0.05). AD had higher tau than SYN + AD in all regions (F1, 43 = 12.8-97.2, p < 0.001); however, SYN + AD had a greater proportion of tau in the temporal neocortex than AD (t41 = 2.0, p < 0.05), whereas AD had a greater proportion of tau in the frontal neocortex than SYN + AD (t41 = 3.3, p < 0.002). SYN + AD had similar severity and distribution of neocortical Aβ compared to AD (F1, 40-43 = 1.6-2.0, p > 0.1).
INTERPRETATION: LBD patients with AD copathology harbor greater neocortical SYN pathology. Regional tau pathology relates to cognitive performance in LBD dementia, and its distribution may diverge from pure AD. Tau copathology contributes uniquely to the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in LBD. Ann Neurol 2018; 1-13 ANN NEUROL 2019;85:259-271.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses that (1) antemortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels correlate with postmortem tau pathology in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and (2) tauopathy patients have higher phosphorylated-tau levels compared to transactivation response element DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy patients while accounting for Alzheimer's disease (AD) copathology.
METHODS: Patients had autopsy-confirmed FTLD with tauopathy (n = 31), TDP-43 proteinopathy (n = 49), or AD (n = 26) with antemortem CSF. CSF tau levels were compared between groups and correlated with digital histology measurement of postmortem tau pathology averaged from three cerebral regions (angular gyrus, mid-frontal cortex, and anterior cingulate gyrus). Multivariate linear regression tested the association of ante mortem CSF tau levels with postmortem tau pathology adjusting for demographics.
RESULTS: Multivariate regression found an independent association of ante mortem CSF phosphorylated tau levels with postmortem cerebral tau pathology in FTLD (Beta = 1.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.2-2.4; p < 0.02). After excluding patients with coincident AD-associated tau pathology accompanying sporadic FTLD, we found lower CSF phosphorylated tau levels in the TDP-43 group (median = 7.4pg/ml; interquartile range [IQR] = 6.0, 12.3; n = 26) compared to the tauopathy group (median = 12.5pg/ml; IQR = 10.7, 15.0; n = 23; Z = 2.6; p < 0.01).
INTERPRETATION: CSF phosphorylated-tau levels are positively associated with cerebral tau burden in FTLD. In vivo detection of AD copathology in sporadic FTLD patients may help stratify clinical cohorts with pure neuropathology in which low CSF phosphorylated-tau levels may have diagnostic utility to distinguish TDP-43 proteinopathy from tauopathy. Autopsy-confirmed samples are critical for FTLD biomarker development and validation. Ann Neurol 2017;82:247-258.},

Some improvement was observed with consensus evaluation but not with central staining of slides. Evaluation of glass slides and digitally prepared whole-slide images was comparable.

	Abstract = {Modern morphometric studies use non-linear image registration to compare anatomies and perform group analysis. Recently, log-Euclidean approaches have contributed to promote the use of such computational anatomy tools by permitting simple computations of statistics on a rather large class of invertible spatial transformations. In this work, we propose a non-linear registration algorithm perfectly fit for log-Euclidean statistics on diffeomorphisms. Our algorithm works completely in the log-domain, i.e. it uses a stationary velocity field. This implies that we guarantee the invertibility of the deformation and have access to the true inverse transformation. This also means that our output can be directly used for log-Euclidean statistics without relying on the heavy computation of the log of the spatial transformation. As it is often desirable, our algorithm is symmetric with respect to the order of the input images. Furthermore, we use an alternate optimization approach related to Thirion's demons algorithm to provide a fast non-linear registration algorithm. First results show that our algorithm outperforms both the demons algorithm and the recently proposed diffeomorphic demons algorithm in terms of accuracy of the transformation while remaining computationally efficient.},

	Abstract = {Perception can be cast as a process of inference, in which bottom-up signals are combined with top-down predictions in sensory systems. In line with this, neural activity in sensory cortex is strongly modulated by prior expectations. Such top-down predictions often arise from cross-modal associations, such as when a sound (e.g., bell or bark) leads to an expectation of the visual appearance of the corresponding object (e.g., bicycle or dog). We hypothesized that the hippocampus, which rapidly learns arbitrary relationships between stimuli over space and time, may be involved in forming such associative predictions. We exposed male and female human participants to auditory cues predicting visual shapes, while measuring high-resolution fMRI signals in visual cortex and the hippocampus. Using multivariate reconstruction methods, we discovered a dissociation between these regions: representations in visual cortex were dominated by whichever shape was presented, whereas representations in the hippocampus reflected only which shape was predicted by the cue. The strength of hippocampal predictions correlated across participants with the amount of expectation-related facilitation in visual cortex. These findings help bridge the gap between memory and sensory systems in the human brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The way we perceive the world is to a great extent determined by our prior knowledge. Despite this intimate link between perception and memory, these two aspects of cognition have mostly been studied in isolation. Here we investigate their interaction by asking how memory systems that encode and retrieve associations can inform perception. We find that upon hearing a familiar auditory cue, the hippocampus represents visual information that had previously co-occurred with the cue, even when this expectation differs from what is currently visible. Furthermore, the strength of this hippocampal expectation correlates with facilitation of perceptual processing in visual cortex. These findings help bridge the gap between memory and sensory systems in the human brain.},

	Abstract = {The ability to keep similar experiences separate in memory is critical for forming unique and lasting memories, as many events share overlapping features (e.g., birthday parties, holidays). Research on memory in young children suggests their memories often lack high-resolution details, i.e., show impoverished pattern separation (PS). Recently developed assessments of PS suitable for children allow us to relate the formation of distinct, detailed memories for the development of the hippocampus, a neural structure critical for this ability in adults. The hippocampus displays a protracted developmental profile and underlies the ability to form detailed memories. This study examined age-related differences in hippocampal subfield volumes in 4- to 8-year-old children and relations with performance on a mnemonic similarity task (MST) designed to index memory specificity. Results revealed age-moderated associations between MST performance and cornu ammonis 2-4/dentate gyrus subfields. Specifically, age-related differences in the ability to form detailed memories tracked with normative patterns of volume increases followed by reductions over this age range. That is, greater volume correlated with better performance in younger children, whereas smaller volume correlated with better performance in older children. These findings support the hypothesis that developmental differences in hippocampal circuitry contribute to age-related improvements in detailed memory formation during this period.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative T2 and diffusion MRI indices inform about tissue state and microstructure, both of which may be affected by pathology before tissue atrophy.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the capability of both volumetric and quantitative MRI (qMRI) of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) for classification of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD).
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
POPULATION: Consecutive cohorts of healthy age-matched controls (n = 62), aMCI patients (n = 25), and ADD patients (n = 14).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3T using T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, T2 relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
ASSESSMENT: Montreal Cognitive Assessment and paired associate learning tests for cognitive state. Hippocampal subfield volumes by the automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields system from structural brain images. T2 relaxation time and DTI indices quantified for hippocampal subfields. The fraction of voxels with high T2 values (>20 ms above subfield median) was calculated and regionalized for hippocampus and EC.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Support vector machine and receiver operating characteristic analyses from cognitive and MRI data.
RESULTS: qMRI classified aMCI and ADD with excellent sensitivity (79.0% and 94.5%, respectively) and specificity (85.6% and 86.1%, respectively), superior to volumes alone (70.0% and 84.5% for respective sensitivities; 82.2 and 91.1 for respective specificities) and similar to cognitive tests (61.7% and 87.5% for respective sensitivities; 88.2% and 90.7% for respective specificities). Regions of high T2 are dispersed throughout each hippocampal subfield in aMCI and ADD with higher concentration than controls, and was most pronounced in the EC. No other individual qMRI marker than EC volume can separate aMCI from ADD, however. DATA CONCLUSION: qMRI markers of hippocampal and entorhinal tissue states are sensitive and specific classifiers of aMCI and ADD. They may serve as markers of a neurodegenerative state preceding volume loss.

	Abstract = {Substantial work associates late-life depression with hippocampal pathology. However, there is less information about differences in hippocampal subfields and other connected temporal lobe regions and how these regions may be influenced by vascular factors. Individuals aged 60 years or older with and without a DSM-IV diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder completed clinical assessments and 3 T cranial MRI using a protocol allowing for automated measurement of medial temporal lobe subfield volumes. A subset also completed pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, allowing for the measurement of hippocampal cerebral blood flow. In 59 depressed and 21 never-depressed elders (mean age = 66.4 years, SD = 5.8y, range 60-86y), the depressed group did not exhibit statistically significant volumetric differences for the total hippocampus or hippocampal subfields but did exhibit significantly smaller volumes of the perirhinal cortex, specifically in the BA36 region. Additionally, age had a greater effect in the depressed group on volumes of the cornu ammonis, entorhinal cortex, and BA36 region. Finally, both clinical and radiological markers of vascular risk were associated with smaller BA36 volumes, while reduced hippocampal blood flow was associated with smaller hippocampal and cornu ammonis volumes. In conclusion, while we did not observe group differences in hippocampal regions, we observed group differences and an effect of vascular pathology on the BA36 region, part of the perirhinal cortex. This is a critical region exhibiting atrophy in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, the observed greater effect of age in the depressed groups is concordant with past longitudinal studies reporting greater hippocampal atrophy in late-life depression.},

	Abstract = {Focal electrical stimulation of the brain incites a cascade of neural activity that propagates from the stimulated region to both nearby and remote areas, offering the potential to control the activity of brain networks. Understanding how exogenous electrical signals perturb such networks in humans is key to its clinical translation. To investigate this, we applied electrical stimulation to subregions of the medial temporal lobe in 26 neurosurgical patients fitted with indwelling electrodes. Networks of low-frequency (5-13 Hz) spectral coherence predicted stimulation-evoked increases in theta (5-8 Hz) power, particularly when stimulation was applied in or adjacent to white matter. Stimulation tended to decrease power in the high-frequency broadband (HFB; 50-200 Hz) range, and these modulations were correlated with HFB-based networks in a subset of subjects. Our results demonstrate that functional connectivity is predictive of causal changes in the brain, capturing evoked activity across brain regions and frequency bands.},

	Abstract = {Emotional experiences are typically remembered with a greater sense of recollection than neutral experiences, but memory benefits for emotional items do not typically extend to their source contexts. Item and source memory have been attributed to different subregions of the medial temporal lobes (MTL), but it is unclear how emotional item recollection fits into existing models of MTL function and, in particular, what is the role of the hippocampus. To address these issues, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine MTL contributions to successful emotional item and context encoding. The results showed that emotional items were recollected more often than neutral items. Whereas amygdala and perirhinal cortex (PRC) activity supported the recollection advantage for emotional items, hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activity predicted subsequent source memory for both types of items, reflecting a double dissociation between anterior and posterior MTL regions. In addition, amygdala activity during encoding modulated the relationships of PRC activity and hippocampal activity to subsequent item recollection and source memory, respectively. Specifically, whereas PRC activity best predicted subsequent item recollection when amygdala activity was relatively low, hippocampal activity best predicted source memory when amygdala activity was relatively high. We interpret these findings in terms of complementary compared to synergistic amygdala-MTL interactions. The results suggest that emotion-related enhancements in item recollection are supported by an amygdala-PRC pathway, which is separable from the hippocampal pathway that binds items to their source context.},

@article{delhaye19,
	Abstract = {Unitization, that is, the encoding of an association as one integrated entity, has been shown to improve associative memory in populations presenting with associative memory deficit due to hippocampal dysfunction, such as amnesic patients with focal hippocampal lesions and healthy older adults. One reason for this benefit is that encoding of unitized associations would rely on the perirhinal cortex (PrC) and thus minimize the need for hippocampal recruitment. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is accompanied by a deficit in associative memory. However, unitization has never been studied to explore the potential benefit in associative memory in MCI, maybe because MCI is characterized by PrC pathology. However, the PrC may potentially still function sufficiently to allow for the successful adoption of unitization. In this study, we aimed at assessing whether unitization could attenuate MCI patients' associative memory deficit, and whether the ability to remember unitized associations would be modulated by the integrity of the PrC in MCI patients. Unitization was manipulated at a conceptual level, by encouraging participants to encode unrelated word pairs as new compound words. Participants also underwent a structural MRI exam, and measures of PrC were extracted (Brodmann Areas [BA] 35 and 36). Results showed that, contrary to healthy controls, MCI patients did not benefit from unitization. Moreover, their memory performance for unitized associations was related to the measure of PrC integrity (BA35), while it was not the case in controls. This finding thus suggests that unitization does not help to attenuate the associative deficit in MCI patients, and brings support to the literature linking unitization to the PrC function.},

	Abstract = {Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common neurological disorder affecting the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL). Although prior studies have analyzed whole-brain network distortions in TLE patients, the functional network architecture of the MTL at the subregion level has not been examined. In this study, we utilized high-resolution 7T T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state BOLD-fMRI to characterize volumetric asymmetry and functional network asymmetry of MTL subregions in unilateral medically refractory TLE patients and healthy controls. We subdivided the TLE group into mesial temporal sclerosis patients (TLE-MTS) and MRI-negative nonlesional patients (TLE-NL). Using an automated multi-atlas segmentation pipeline, we delineated 10 MTL subregions per hemisphere for each subject. We found significantly different patterns of volumetric asymmetry between the two groups, with TLE-MTS exhibiting volumetric asymmetry corresponding to decreased volumes ipsilaterally in all hippocampal subfields, and TLE-NL exhibiting no significant volumetric asymmetries other than a mild decrease in whole-hippocampal volume ipsilaterally. We also found significantly different patterns of functional network asymmetry in the CA1 subfield and whole hippocampus, with TLE-NL patients exhibiting asymmetry corresponding to increased connectivity ipsilaterally and TLE-MTS patients exhibiting asymmetry corresponding to decreased connectivity ipsilaterally. Our findings provide initial evidence that functional neuroimaging-based network properties within the MTL can distinguish between TLE subtypes. High-resolution MRI has potential to improve localization of underlying brain network disruptions in TLE patients who are candidates for surgical resection.},

	Abstract = {Episodic memory function has been shown to depend critically on the hippocampus. This region is made up of a number of subfields, which differ in both cytoarchitectural features and functional roles in the mature brain. Recent neuroimaging work in children and adolescents has suggested that these regions may undergo different developmental trajectories-a fact that has important implications for how we think about learning and memory processes in these populations. Despite the growing research interest in hippocampal structure and function at the subfield level in healthy young adults, comparatively fewer studies have been carried out looking at subfield development. One barrier to studying these questions has been that manual segmentation of hippocampal subfields-considered by many to be the best available approach for defining these regions-is laborious and can be infeasible for large cross-sectional or longitudinal studies of cognitive development. Moreover, manual segmentation requires some subjectivity and is not impervious to bias or error. In a developmental sample of individuals spanning 6-30 years, we assessed the degree to which two semi-automated segmentation approaches-one approach based on Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) and another utilizing Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)-approximated manual subfield delineation on each individual by a single expert rater. Our main question was whether performance varied as a function of age group. Across several quantitative metrics, we found negligible differences in subfield validity across the child, adolescent, and adult age groups, suggesting that these methods can be reliably applied to developmental studies. We conclude that ASHS outperforms ANTs overall and is thus preferable for analyses carried out in individual subject space. However, we underscore that ANTs is also acceptable and may be well-suited for analyses requiring normalization to a single group template (e.g., voxelwise analyses across a wide age range). Previous work has supported the use of such methods in healthy young adults, as well as several special populations such as older adults and those suffering from mild cognitive impairment. Our results extend these previous findings to show that ASHS and ANTs can also be used in pediatric populations as young as six.},

Similar observations, sometimes implicating other sections of the hippocampus, have been made for aging populations and for people with neurodegenerative diseases that affect the hippocampus. These data support the hypothesis that hippocampal volume relates to navigation ability. However, the support for this hypothesis is mixed in healthy, young adults, who range widely in their navigation ability. Here, we administered a naturalistic navigation task that measures cognitive map accuracy to a sample of 90 healthy, young adults who also had MRI scans. Using a sequential analysis design with a registered analysis plan, we did not find that navigation ability related to hippocampal volume (total, right only, right posterior only). We conclude that navigation ability in a typical population does not correlate with variations in hippocampal size, and consider possible explanations for this null result.},

It is comprised of cytologically distinct subregions that, in concert, give rise to successful encoding and retrieval of context-dependent memories. However, the functional connections between these subregions are poorly understood. To determine functional connectivity among MTL subregions, we had 131 subjects fitted with indwelling electrodes perform a verbal memory task and asked how encoding or retrieval correlated with inter-regional synchronization. Using phase-based measures of connectivity, we found that synchronous theta (4-8 Hz) activity underlies successful episodic memory. During encoding, we observed a dynamic pattern of connections converging on the left entorhinal cortex, beginning with the perirhinal cortex and shifting through hippocampal subfields. Retrieval-associated networks demonstrated enhanced involvement of the subiculum and CA1, reflecting a substantial reorganization of the encoding network. We posit that coherent theta activity within the MTL marks periods of successful memory, but distinct patterns of connectivity dissociate key stages of memory processing.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the global increase in the aging population and age-related diseases, the promotion of healthy aging is one of the most crucial public health issues. This trial aims to contribute to the establishment of effective approaches to promote cognitive and brain health in older individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Presence of SCD is known to increase the risk of objective cognitive decline and progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is our primary goal to determine whether spermidine supplementation has a positive impact on memory performance in this at-risk group, as compared with placebo. The secondary goal is to examine the effects of spermidine intake on other neuropsychological, behavioral, and physiological parameters.
METHODS: The SmartAge trial is a monocentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial. The study will investigate 12 months of intervention with spermidine-based nutritional supplementation (target intervention) compared with 12 months of placebo intake (control intervention). We plan to recruit 100 cognitively normal older individuals with SCD from memory clinics, neurologists and general practitioners in private practice, and the general population. Participants will be allocated to one of the two study arms using blockwise randomization stratified by age and sex with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome is the change in memory performance between baseline and post-intervention visits (12 months after baseline). Secondary outcomes include the change in memory performance from baseline to follow-up assessment (18 months after baseline), as well as changes in neurocognitive, behavioral, and physiological parameters (including blood and neuroimaging biomarkers), assessed at baseline and post-intervention.
DISCUSSION: The SmartAge trial aims to provide evidence of the impact of spermidine supplementation on memory performance in older individuals with SCD. In addition, we will identify possible neurophysiological mechanisms of action underlying the anticipated cognitive benefits. Overall, this trial will contribute to the establishment of nutrition intervention in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.

	Abstract = {Discriminative learning is a paradigm that has been used in animal studies, in which memory of a stimulus is enhanced when it is presented with a similar stimulus rather than with a different one. Human studies have shown that through discriminative learning of similar objects, both item memory and contextual memories are enhanced. However, the underlying neural mechanisms for it are unclear. The hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (PRC) are two possible regions involved in discriminating similar stimuli and forming distinctive memory representations. In this study, 28 participants (15 males) were scanned using high-resolution fMRI when a picture (e.g., a dog) was paired with the same picture, with a similar picture of the same concept (e.g., another dog), or with a picture of a different concept (e.g., a cat). Then, after intervals of 20 min and 1 week, the participants were asked to perform an old/new recognition task, followed by a contextual judgment. The results showed that during encoding, there was stronger activation in the PRC for the "similar" than for the "same" and "different" conditions and it predicted subsequent item memory for the "similar" condition. The hippocampal activation decreased for the "same" versus the "different" condition and the DG/CA3 activation predicted subsequent contextual memory for the "similar" condition. These results suggested that the PRC and hippocampus are functionally dissociated in encoding simultaneously presented objects and predicting subsequent item and contextual memories after discriminative learning.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT How the brain separates similar input into nonoverlapping representations and forms distinct memory for them is a fundamental question for the neuroscience of memory. By discriminative learning of similar (vs different) objects, both item and contextual memories are enhanced. This study found functional dissociations between perirhinal cortex (PRC) and hippocampus in discriminating pairs of similar and different objects and in predicting subsequent memory of similar objects in their item and contextual aspects. The results provided clear evidence on the neural mechanisms of discriminative learning and highlighted the importance of the PRC and hippocampus in processing different types of object information when the objects were simultaneously presented.},

	Abstract = {Cognitive assessments and neuroimaging are routinely combined in clinical practice to diagnose dementia represented by Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is reported to be more suitable than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for screening mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD. On the other hand, attention to the subfield volumes of the medial temporal lobe has recently been considered important for the differential diagnosis and early detection of AD. The aim of this study was to uncover which specific hippocampal subfields and adjacent extrahippocampal structures contribute to deficits in cognitive assessment scores in patients with MCI and AD. We recruited from our institute 31 Japanese patients-14 with amnestic MCI and 17 with probable AD, with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0.5 and 1, respectively-and 50 healthy elderly individuals with a CDR of 0. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive assessments with the MMSE, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory I and II, and Japanese version of the MoCA (MoCA-J). With adjustment for age and sex, we performed partial correlation analysis of the cognitive assessment scores with the subfield volumes of the medial temporal lobe measured by software-mediated automatic segmentation of hippocampal subfields using high-resolution T1-and T2-weighted images. Compared with normal controls, patients with MCI and AD showed subfield volume reductions in cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA2, Brodmann area (BA) 35, BA36, the dentate gyrus (DG), the subiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (ERC). All participants showed high correlation coefficients (above 0.6) between cognitive assessment scores and subfield volumes in CA1, the DG, the subiculum, the ERC, and BA36. In patients with MCI and AD, the MoCA-J showed higher correlations than the MMSE with subfield volumes in CA1, the DG, the subiculum, and the ERC. These results suggest that the combination of the in vivo analysis of subfield morphometry of the medial temporal lobe with the MoCA-J paradigm provides important insights into whether changes within specific subfields are related to the cognitive profile in MCI and AD.},

	Abstract = {Because multivariate autoregressive models have failed to adequately account for the complexity of neural signals, researchers have predominantly relied on non-parametric methods when studying the relations between brain and behavior. Using medial temporal lobe (MTL) recordings from 96 neurosurgical patients, we show that time series models with volatility described by a multivariate stochastic latent-variable process and lagged interactions between signals in different brain regions provide new insights into the dynamics of brain function. The implied volatility inferred from our process positively correlates with high-frequency spectral activity, a signal that correlates with neuronal activity. We show that volatility features derived from our model can reliably decode memory states, and that this classifier performs as well as those using spectral features. Using the directional connections between brain regions during complex cognitive process provided by the model, we uncovered perirhinal-hippocampal desynchronization in the MTL regions that is associated with successful memory encoding.},

	Abstract = {Chronically implantable neurostimulation devices are becoming a clinically viable option for treating patients with neurological disease and psychiatric disorders. Neurostimulation offers the ability to probe and manipulate distributed networks of interacting brain areas in dysfunctional circuits. Here, we use tools from network control theory to examine the dynamic reconfiguration of functionally interacting neuronal ensembles during targeted neurostimulation of cortical and subcortical brain structures. By integrating multimodal intracranial recordings and diffusion-weighted imaging from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, we test hypothesized structural and functional rules that predict altered patterns of synchronized local field potentials. We demonstrate the ability to predictably reconfigure functional interactions depending on stimulation strength and location. Stimulation of areas with structurally weak connections largely modulates the functional hubness of downstream areas and concurrently propels the brain towards more difficult-to-reach dynamical states. By using focal perturbations to bridge large-scale structure, function, and markers of behavior, our findings suggest that stimulation may be tuned to influence different scales of network interactions driving cognition.},

We find statistically significant shared variance between the predicted activity state transitions and the observed activity state transitions. We then use an optimal control framework to posit testable hypotheses regarding which brain states and structural properties will efficiently improve memory encoding when stimulated.

	Abstract = {Mnemonic discrimination, the ability to distinguish similar events in memory, relies on subregions in the human medial temporal lobes (MTLs). Tau pathology is frequently found within the MTL of older adults and therefore likely to affect mnemonic discrimination, even in healthy older individuals. The MTL subregions that are known to be affected early by tau pathology, the perirhinal-transentorhinal region (area 35) and the anterior-lateral entorhinal cortex (alEC), have recently been implicated in the mnemonic discrimination of objects rather than scenes. Here we used an object-scene mnemonic discrimination task in combination with fMRI recordings and analyzed the relationship between subregional MTL activity, memory performance, and levels of total and phosphorylated tau as well as Aβ42/40 ratio in CSF. We show that activity in alEC was associated with mnemonic discrimination of similar objects but not scenes in male and female cognitively unimpaired older adults. Importantly, CSF tau levels were associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, and both increased hippocampal activity as well as tau levels were associated with mnemonic discrimination of objects, but again not scenes. This suggests that dysfunction of the alEC-hippocampus object mnemonic discrimination network might be a marker for tau-related cognitive decline.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Subregions in the human medial temporal lobe are critically involved in episodic memory and, at the same time, affected by tau pathology. Impaired object mnemonic discrimination performance as well as aberrant activity within the entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry have been reported in earlier studies involving older individuals, but it has thus far remained elusive whether and how tau pathology is implicated in this specific impairment. Using task-related fMRI in combination with measures of tau pathology in CSF, we show that measures of tau pathology are associated with increased hippocampal activity and reduced mnemonic discrimination of similar objects but not scenes. This suggests that object mnemonic discrimination tasks could be promising markers for tau-related cognitive decline.},

Although single neurons in the medial temporal lobe activate to represent locations in the environment during navigation, how this spatial tuning relates to memory for events involving those locations remains unclear. We examined memory-related changes in spatial tuning by recording single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients performing a virtual-reality object-location memory task. We identified 'memory-trace cells' with activity that was spatially tuned to the retrieved location of the specific object that participants were cued to remember. Memory-trace cells in the entorhinal cortex, in particular, encoded discriminable representations of different memories through a memory-specific rate code.

	Abstract = {When an action is familiar, we are able to anticipate how it will change the state of the world. These expectations can result from retrieval of action-outcome associations in the hippocampus and the reinstatement of anticipated outcomes in visual cortex. How does this role for the hippocampus in action-based prediction change over time? We use high-resolution fMRI and a dual-training behavioral paradigm to examine how the hippocampus interacts with visual cortex during predictive and nonpredictive actions learned either three days earlier or immediately before the scan. Just-learned associations led to comparable background connectivity between the hippocampus and V1/V2, regardless of whether actions predicted outcomes. However, three-day-old associations led to stronger background connectivity and greater differentiation between neural patterns for predictive vs. nonpredictive actions. Hippocampal prediction may initially reflect indiscriminate binding of co-occurring events, with action information pruning weaker associations and leading to more selective and accurate predictions over time.},

	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Cognitive decline is a leading cause of disability and death in old age but its neurobiological bases are not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is related to late-life cognitive decline.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study involving more than 40 Catholic groups across the United States. A total of 130 older Catholic nuns, priests, and monks underwent annual clinical evaluations, including detailed cognitive testing, for a mean of 10.1 years prior to death. On neuropathologic examination, we collected semiquantitative measures of TDP-43 pathology, density of neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, area occupied by amyloid-beta plaques, and the presence of alpha-synuclein Lewy bodies from multiple brain regions. Gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts and hippocampal sclerosis were also identified.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual rate of change in a previously established composite measure of global cognition during a mean of 10.1 years of annual observation before death.
RESULTS: Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 pathology, ranging from sparse to severe, was identified in 46% of participants and was associated with amyloid plaques, tangles, and hippocampal sclerosis but not neocortical Lewy bodies or cerebral infarcts. After controlling for amyloid plaques, tangles, and hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43 pathology was associated with more rapid cognitive decline and accounted for nearly as much of the variability in rates of global cognitive decline as did tangles. Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 pathology had a distinct cognitive profile that differed from other neuropathologic processes (related to decline in episodic and working memory but not in other cognitive domains), and it was elevated in those who developed dementia but not in those with mild cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that TDP-43 is an important brain pathology underlying cognitive decline and dementia in old age.},

Here, we report a neuroimaging study correlating hippocampal deformity with regional AD and transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA pathology burden. We used hippocampal shape analysis of ante-mortem T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging images of 42 participants from two longitudinal cohort studies conducted by the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center. Surfaces were generated for the whole hippocampus and zones approximating the underlying subfields using a previously developed automated image-segmentation pipeline. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to correlate the shape with pathology measures while accounting for covariates, with relationships mapped out onto hippocampal surface locations. A significant relationship existed between higher paired helical filaments-tau burden and inward hippocampal shape deformity in zones approximating CA1 and subiculum which persisted after accounting for coexisting pathologies. No significant patterns of inward surface deformity were associated with amyloid-beta or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA after including covariates. Our findings indicate that hippocampal shape deformity measures in surface zones approximating CA1 may represent a biomarker for postmortem AD pathology.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, the transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) has been recognized as a major protein in normal and pathological ageing, increasing the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. In conditions distinct from the frontotemporal lobar degenerations, TDP-43 appears to progress in a stereotypical pattern. In the present study, we aimed at providing a better understanding of the effects of TDP-43 and other age-related neuropathologies on cross-sectional grey matter volume in a cohort of non-FTLD subjects. We included 407 individuals with an antemortem MRI and post-mortem brain tissue from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, or the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. All individuals were assigned pathological stages for TDP-43, tau, amyloid-β, Lewy bodies, argyrophilic grain disease and vascular pathologies. Robust regressions were performed in regions of interest and voxel-wise to explore the relationships between TDP-43 stages and grey matter volume while controlling for other pathologies. Grey matter volumes adjusted for pathological and demographic variables were also computed for each TDP-43-positive case to further characterize the sequential involvement of brain structures associated with TDP-43, irrespective of the TDP-43 staging scheme. Robust regressions showed that the extent of TDP-43 pathology was associated with the extent of grey matter atrophy. Specifically, we found that the volume in medial temporal regions (i.e. amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus) decreased progressively with advancing TDP-43 stages. Importantly, these effects were of similar magnitude to those related to tau stages. Additional analyses using adjusted grey matter volume demonstrated a sequential pattern of volume loss associated with TDP-43, starting within the medial temporal lobe, followed by early involvement of the temporal pole, and eventually encompassing additional temporal and frontal regions. Altogether, this study demonstrates the major and independent contribution of TDP-43 pathology on neurodegeneration and provides further insight into the regional distribution of TDP-43 in non-FTLD subjects. Along with previous studies, these findings emphasized the importance of targeting TDP-43 in future clinical trials to prevent its detrimental effect on grey matter volume and, eventually, cognition.},

	Abstract = {There is growing recognition that the pathophysiological process of Alzheimer disease (AD) begins many years prior to clinically obvious symptoms, and the concept of a presymptomatic or preclinical stage of AD is becoming more widely accepted. Advances in biomarker studies have enabled detection of AD pathology in vivo in clinically normal older individuals. The predictive value of these biomarkers at the individual patient level, however, remains to be elucidated. The ultimate goal of identifying individuals in the preclinical stages of AD is to facilitate early intervention to delay and perhaps even prevent emergence of the clinical syndrome. A number of challenges remain to be overcome before this concept can be validated and translated into clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {Algorithms for computer-aided diagnosis of dementia based on structural MRI have demonstrated high performance in the literature, but are difficult to compare as different data sets and methodology were used for evaluation. In addition, it is unclear how the algorithms would perform on previously unseen data, and thus, how they would perform in clinical practice when there is no real opportunity to adapt the algorithm to the data at hand. To address these comparability, generalizability and clinical applicability issues, we organized a grand challenge that aimed to objectively compare algorithms based on a clinically representative multi-center data set. Using clinical practice as the starting point, the goal was to reproduce the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated algorithms for multi-class classification of three diagnostic groups: patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The diagnosis based on clinical criteria was used as reference standard, as it was the best available reference despite its known limitations. For evaluation, a previously unseen test set was used consisting of 354 T1-weighted MRI scans with the diagnoses blinded. Fifteen research teams participated with a total of 29 algorithms. The algorithms were trained on a small training set (n=30) and optionally on data from other sources (e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging). The best performing algorithm yielded an accuracy of 63.0% and an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 78.8%. In general, the best performances were achieved using feature extraction based on voxel-based morphometry or a combination of features that included volume, cortical thickness, shape and intensity. The challenge is open for new submissions via the web-based framework: http://caddementia.grand-challenge.org. },

	Abstract = {Accurate classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), plays a critical role in possibly preventing progression of memory impairment and improving quality of life for AD patients. Among many research tasks, it is of a particular interest to identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight coadaptation, which is a typical cause of overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection, an adaptive learning factor, and a multitask learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI dataset, and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis. Experimental results showed that the dropout technique is very effective in AD diagnosis, improving the classification accuracies by 5.9% on average as compared to the classical deep learning methods. },

	Abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. },

	Abstract = {We built and validated a deep learning algorithm predicting the individual diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment who will convert to AD (c-MCI) based on a single cross-sectional brain structural MRI scan. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were applied on 3D T1-weighted images from ADNI and subjects recruited at our Institute (407 healthy controls [HC], 418 AD, 280 c-MCI, 533 stable MCI [s-MCI]). CNN performance was tested in distinguishing AD, c-MCI and s-MCI. High levels of accuracy were achieved in all the classifications, with the highest rates achieved in the AD vs HC classification tests using both the ADNI dataset only (99%) and the combined ADNI + non-ADNI dataset (98%). CNNs discriminated c-MCI from s-MCI patients with an accuracy up to 75% and no difference between ADNI and non-ADNI images. CNNs provide a powerful tool for the automatic individual patient diagnosis along the AD continuum. Our method performed well without any prior feature engineering and regardless the variability of imaging protocols and scanners, demonstrating that it is exploitable by not-trained operators and likely to be generalizable to unseen patient data. CNNs may accelerate the adoption of structural MRI in routine practice to help assessment and management of patients.},

	Abstract = {Accurate prediction of clinical changes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, including both qualitative change (i.e., conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD)) and quantitative change (i.e., cognitive scores) at future time points, is important for early diagnosis of AD and for monitoring the disease progression. In this paper, we propose to predict future clinical changes of MCI patients by using both baseline and longitudinal multimodality data. To do this, we first develop a longitudinal feature selection method to jointly select brain regions across multiple time points for each modality. Specifically, for each time point, we train a sparse linear regression model by using the imaging data and the corresponding clinical scores, with an extra 'group regularization' to group the weights corresponding to the same brain region across multiple time points together and to allow for selection of brain regions based on the strength of multiple time points jointly. Then, to further reflect the longitudinal changes on the selected brain regions, we extract a set of longitudinal features from the original baseline and longitudinal data. Finally, we combine all features on the selected brain regions, from different modalities, for prediction by using our previously proposed multi-kernel SVM. We validate our method on 88 ADNI MCI subjects, with both MRI and FDG-PET data and the corresponding clinical scores (i.e., MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 5 different time points. We first predict the clinical scores (MMSE and ADAS-Cog) at 24-month by using the multimodality data at previous time points, and then predict the conversion of MCI to AD by using the multimodality data at time points which are at least 6-month ahead of the conversion. The results on both sets of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance in predicting future clinical changes of MCI patients than the conventional methods.},

	Abstract = {Fully automated machine learning methods based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data can assist radiologists in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These algorithms require large data sets to learn the separation of subjects with and without AD. Training and test data may come from heterogeneous hardware settings, which can potentially affect the performance of disease classification. A total of 518 MRI sessions from 226 healthy controls and 191 individuals with probable AD from the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to investigate whether grouping data by acquisition hardware (i.e. vendor, field strength, coil system) is beneficial for the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, compared to the case where data from different hardware is mixed. We compared the change of the SVM decision value resulting from (a) changes in hardware against the effect of disease and (b) changes resulting simply from rescanning the same subject on the same machine. Maximum accuracy of 87% was obtained with a training set of all 417 subjects. Classifiers trained with 95 subjects in each diagnostic group and acquired with heterogeneous scanner settings had an empirical detection accuracy of 84.2$\pm$2.4% when tested on an independent set of the same size. These results mirror the accuracy reported in recent studies. Encouragingly, classifiers trained on images acquired with homogenous and heterogeneous hardware settings had equivalent cross-validation performances. Two scans of the same subject acquired on the same machine had very similar decision values and were generally classified into the same group. Higher variation was introduced when two acquisitions of the same subject were performed on two scanners with different field strengths. The variation was unbiased and similar for both diagnostic groups. The findings of the study encourage the pooling of data from different sites to increase the number of training samples and thereby improving performance of disease classifiers. Although small, a change in hardware could lead to a change of the decision value and thus diagnostic grouping. The findings of this study provide estimators for diagnostic accuracy of an automated disease diagnosis method involving scans acquired with different sets of hardware. Furthermore, we show that the level of confidence in the performance estimation significantly depends on the size of the training sample, and hence should be taken into account in a clinical setting.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to neurodegeneration and can be used to estimate the risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Brain changes in AD and prodromal AD involve a pattern of widespread atrophy. The use of multivariate analysis algorithms could enable the development of diagnostic tools based on structural MRI data. In this study, we investigated the possibility of combining multiple MRI features in the form of a severity index.
METHODS: We used baseline MRI scans from two large multicentre cohorts (AddNeuroMed and ADNI). On the basis of volumetric and cortical thickness measures at baseline with AD cases and healthy control (CTL) subjects as training sets, we generated an MRI-based severity index using the method of orthogonal projection to latent structures (OPLS). The severity index tends to be close to 1 for AD patients and 0 for CTL subjects. Values above 0.5 indicate a more AD-like pattern. The index was then estimated for subjects with MCI, and the accuracy of classification was investigated.
RESULTS: Based on the data at follow-up, 173 subjects converted to AD, of whom 112 (64.7%) were classified as AD-like and 61 (35.3%) as CTL-like.
CONCLUSION: We found that joint evaluation of multiple brain regions provided accurate discrimination between progressive and stable MCI, with better performance than hippocampal volume alone, or a limited set of features. A major challenge is still to determine optimal cut-off points for such parameters and to compare their relative reliability.},

ARD is one of the most successful Bayesian feature selection methods. PARD is a powerful Bayesian feature selection method, and provides sparse models that is easy to interpret. PARD selects the model with the best estimate of the predictive performance instead of choosing the one with the largest marginal model likelihood. Comparative study with support vector machine (SVM) shows that ARD/PARD in general outperform SVM in terms of prediction accuracy. Additional comparison with surface-based general linear model (GLM) analysis shows that regions with strongest signals are identified by both GLM and ARD/PARD. While GLM P-map returns significant regions all over the cortex, ARD/PARD provide a small number of relevant and meaningful imaging markers with predictive power, including both cortical and subcortical measures.},

	Abstract = {Spatial patterns of brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were measured via methods of computational neuroanatomy. These patterns were spatially complex and involved many brain regions. In addition to the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe gray matter, a number of other regions displayed significant atrophy, including orbitofrontal and medial-prefrontal grey matter, cingulate (mainly posterior), insula, uncus, and temporal lobe white matter. Approximately 2/3 of the MCI group presented patterns of atrophy that overlapped with AD, whereas the remaining 1/3 overlapped with cognitively normal individuals, thereby indicating that some, but not all, MCI patients have significant and extensive brain atrophy in this cohort of MCI patients. Importantly, the group with AD-like patterns presented much higher rate of MMSE decline in follow-up visits; conversely, pattern classification provided relatively high classification accuracy (87%) of the individuals that presented relatively higher MMSE decline within a year from baseline. High-dimensional pattern classification, a nonlinear multivariate analysis, provided measures of structural abnormality that can potentially be useful for individual patient classification, as well as for predicting progression and examining multivariate relationships in group analyses.},

	Abstract = {Brain atrophy measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used as an imaging biomarker for disease diagnosis and tracking of pathologic progression in neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we present a generalized and extended formulation of the boundary shift integral (gBSI) using probabilistic segmentations to estimate anatomic changes between 2 time points. This method adaptively estimates a non-binary exclusive OR region of interest from probabilistic brain segmentations of the baseline and repeat scans to better localize and capture the brain atrophy. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing the sample size requirements for a hypothetical clinical trial of Alzheimer's disease to that needed for the current implementation of BSI as well as a fuzzy implementation of BSI. The gBSI method results in a modest but reduced sample size, providing increased sensitivity to disease changes through the use of the probabilistic exclusive OR region. },

	Abstract = {Best practices are currently being developed for the acquisition and processing of resting-state magnetic resonance imaging data used to estimate brain functional organization-or "functional connectivity." Standards have been proposed based on test-retest reliability, but open questions remain. These include how amount of data per subject influences whole-brain reliability, the influence of increasing runs versus sessions, the spatial distribution of reliability, the reliability of multivariate methods, and, crucially, how reliability maps onto prediction of behavior. We collected a dataset of 12 extensively sampled individuals (144 min data each across 2 identically configured scanners) to assess test-retest reliability of whole-brain connectivity within the generalizability theory framework. We used Human Connectome Project data to replicate these analyses and relate reliability to behavioral prediction. Overall, the historical 5-min scan produced poor reliability averaged across connections. Increasing the number of sessions was more beneficial than increasing runs. Reliability was lowest for subcortical connections and highest for within-network cortical connections. Multivariate reliability was greater than univariate. Finally, reliability could not be used to improve prediction; these findings are among the first to underscore this distinction for functional connectivity. A comprehensive understanding of test-retest reliability, including its limitations, supports the development of best practices in the field.},

Here, we report an evaluation of test-retest reliability of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures, including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity, in several white matter tracts previously shown to be involved in cognitive control. In a data set consisting of 34 healthy participants scanned twice on a single day, we observe overall stability of DTI measures. This stability remained in a subset of participants who were also scanned a third time on the same day as well as in a 2-week follow-up session. We conclude that DTI measures in these tracts show relative stability, and that alternative explanations for the recent failures of replication must be considered.},

Automated segmentation software has improved the feasibility of this approach, but often the reliability of measurements is uncertain. We have established a unique dataset to assess the repeatability of brain segmentation and analysis methods. We acquired 120 T1-weighted volumes from 3 subjects (40 volumes/subject) in 20 sessions spanning 31 days, using the protocol recommended by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Each subject was scanned twice within each session, with repositioning between the two scans, allowing determination of test-retest reliability both within a single session (intra-session) and from day to day (inter-session). To demonstrate the application of the dataset, all 3D volumes were processed using FreeSurfer v5.1. The coefficient of variation of volumetric measurements was between 1.6% (caudate) and 6.1% (thalamus). Inter-session variability exceeded intra-session variability for lateral ventricle volume (P<0.0001), indicating that ventricle volume in the subjects varied between days. },

These properties have attracted researchers in the medical imaging community, and we have seen rapid adoption in many traditional and novel applications, such as image reconstruction, segmentation, detection, classification, and cross-modality synthesis. Based on our observations, this trend will continue and we therefore conducted a review of recent advances in medical imaging using the adversarial training scheme with the hope of benefiting researchers interested in this technique.},

	Abstract = {Classical deformable registration techniques achieve impressive results and offer a rigorous theoretical treatment, but are computationally intensive since they solve an optimization problem for each image pair. Recently, learning-based methods have facilitated fast registration by learning spatial deformation functions. However, these approaches use restricted deformation models, require supervised labels, or do not guarantee a diffeomorphic (topology-preserving) registration. Furthermore, learning-based registration tools have not been derived from a probabilistic framework that can offer uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we build a connection between classical and learning-based methods. We present a probabilistic generative model and derive an unsupervised learning-based inference algorithm that uses insights from classical registration methods and makes use of recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We demonstrate our method on a 3D brain registration task for both images and anatomical surfaces, and provide extensive empirical analyses of the algorithm. Our principled approach results in state of the art accuracy and very fast runtimes, while providing diffeomorphic guarantees.

	Abstract = {This paper introduces Quicksilver, a fast deformable image registration method. Quicksilver registration for image-pairs works by patch-wise prediction of a deformation model based directly on image appearance. A deep encoder-decoder network is used as the prediction model. While the prediction strategy is general, we focus on predictions for the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model. Specifically, we predict the momentum-parameterization of LDDMM, which facilitates a patch-wise prediction strategy while maintaining the theoretical properties of LDDMM, such as guaranteed diffeomorphic mappings for sufficiently strong regularization. We also provide a probabilistic version of our prediction network which can be sampled during the testing time to calculate uncertainties in the predicted deformations. Finally, we introduce a new correction network which greatly increases the prediction accuracy of an already existing prediction network. We show experimental results for uni-modal atlas-to-image as well as uni-/multi-modal image-to-image registrations. These experiments demonstrate that our method accurately predicts registrations obtained by numerical optimization, is very fast, achieves state-of-the-art registration results on four standard validation datasets, and can jointly learn an image similarity measure. Quicksilver is freely available as an open-source software.},

	Abstract = {Segmentation of key brain tissues from 3D medical images is of great significance for brain disease diagnosis, progression assessment and monitoring of neurologic conditions. While manual segmentation is time-consuming, laborious, and subjective, automated segmentation is quite challenging due to the complicated anatomical environment of brain and the large variations of brain tissues. We propose a novel voxelwise residual network (VoxResNet) with a set of effective training schemes to cope with this challenging problem. The main merit of residual learning is that it can alleviate the degradation problem when training a deep network so that the performance gains achieved by increasing the network depth can be fully leveraged. With this technique, our VoxResNet is built with 25 layers, and hence can generate more representative features to deal with the large variations of brain tissues than its rivals using hand-crafted features or shallower networks. In order to effectively train such a deep network with limited training data for brain segmentation, we seamlessly integrate multi-modality and multi-level contextual information into our network, so that the complementary information of different modalities can be harnessed and features of different scales can be exploited. Furthermore, an auto-context version of the VoxResNet is proposed by combining the low-level image appearance features, implicit shape information, and high-level context together for further improving the segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on the well-known benchmark (i.e., MRBrainS) of brain segmentation from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images corroborated the efficacy of the proposed VoxResNet. Our method achieved the first place in the challenge out of 37 competitors including several state-of-the-art brain segmentation methods. Our method is inherently general and can be readily applied as a powerful tool to many brain-related studies, where accurate segmentation of brain structures is critical.},

	Abstract = {Insoluble pools of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit considerable N- and C-terminal heterogeneity. Mounting evidence suggests that both C-terminal extensions and N-terminal truncations help precipitate amyloid plaque formation. Although mechanisms underlying the increased generation of C-terminally extended peptides have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying production of N-terminally truncated Abeta. Thus, we used human NT2N neurons to investigate the production of Abeta11-40/42 from amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE). When comparing undifferentiated human embryonal carcinoma NT2- cells and differentiated NT2N neurons, the secretion of sAPP and Abeta correlated with BACE expression. To study the effects of BACE expression on endogenous APP metabolism in human cells, we overexpressed BACE in undifferentiated NT2- cells and NT2N neurons. Whereas NT2N neurons produced both full-length and truncated Abeta as a result of normal processing of endogenous APP, BACE overexpression increased the secretion of Abeta1-40/42 and Abeta11-40/42 in both NT2- cells and NT2N neurons. Furthermore, BACE overexpression resulted in increased intracellular Abeta1-40/42 and Abeta11-40/42. Therefore, we conclude that Abeta11-40/42 is generated prior to deposition in senile plaques and that N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides may contribute to the downstream effects of amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {To date, there have been few systematic attempts to provide a standard operating procedure for the neuropathological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Pathological examination cannot classify the clinical syndrome with certainty; therefore, the neuropathological diagnosis is, at best, a probability statement. The neuropathological diagnosis of parkinsonism has become increasingly based on fundamental molecular underpinnings, with recognition that the genetics of parkinsonism is heterogeneous and includes disorders that are associated with and without Lewy bodies. The advent of alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry has substantially improved the ability to identify Lewy pathology, particularly cortical Lewy bodies and smaller aggregates within processes and the neuropil. In this Review we discuss the diagnostic criteria for the neuropathological assessment of PD. These criteria are provisional and need to be validated through an iterative process that could help with their refinement. Additionally, we suggest future directions for neuropathology research on PD.},

	Abstract = {Aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) describes tau pathology in astrocytes in different locations and anatomical regions. In the present study we addressed the question of whether sequential distribution patterns can be recognized for ARTAG or astroglial tau pathologies in both primary FTLD-tauopathies and non-FTLD-tauopathy cases. By evaluating 687 postmortem brains with diverse disorders we identified ARTAG in 455. We evaluated frequencies and hierarchical clustering of anatomical involvement and used conditional probability and logistic regression to model the sequential distribution of ARTAG and astroglial tau pathologies across different brain regions. For subpial and white matter ARTAG we recognize three and two patterns, respectively, each with three stages initiated or ending in the amygdala. Subependymal ARTAG does not show a clear sequential pattern. For grey matter (GM) ARTAG we recognize four stages including a striatal pathway of spreading towards the cortex and/or amygdala, and the brainstem, and an amygdala pathway, which precedes the involvement of the striatum and/or cortex and proceeds towards the brainstem. GM ARTAG and astrocytic plaque pathology in corticobasal degeneration follows a predominantly frontal-parietal cortical to temporal-occipital cortical, to subcortical, to brainstem pathway (four stages). GM ARTAG and tufted astrocyte pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy shows a striatum to frontal-parietal cortical to temporal to occipital, to amygdala, and to brainstem sequence (four stages). In Pick's disease cases with astroglial tau pathology an overlapping pattern with PSP can be appreciated. We conclude that tau-astrogliopathy type-specific sequential patterns cannot be simplified as neuron-based staging systems. The proposed cytopathological and hierarchical stages provide a conceptual approach to identify the initial steps of the pathogenesis of tau pathologies in ARTAG and primary FTLD-tauopathies.},

To address these issues, here we present a comparative survey of the topographical distribution of the defining molecular neuropathological lesions among 10 neurodegenerative diseases from a large and uniformly assessed brain collection. Ratings of pathological severity in 16 brain regions from 671 cases with diverse neurodegenerative diseases are summarized and analyzed. These include: 1) amyloid-β and tau lesions in Alzheimer's disease; 2) tau lesions in three other tauopathies including Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration; 3) α-synuclein inclusion ratings in four synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy; and 4) TDP-43 lesions in two TDP-43 proteinopathies, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with TDP-43 and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The data presented graphically and topographically confirm and extend previous pathological anatomic descriptions and statistical comparisons highlight the lesion distributions that either overlap or distinguish the diseases in each molecular disease category.},

	Abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are defined by the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits in the central nervous system (CNS), and only neuropathological examination enables a definitive diagnosis. Brain banks and their associated scientific programs have shaped the actual knowledge of NDs, identifying and characterizing the CNS deposits that define new diseases, formulating staging schemes, and establishing correlations between neuropathological changes and clinical features. However, brain banks have evolved to accommodate the banking of biofluids as well as DNA and RNA samples. Moreover, the value of biobanks is greatly enhanced if they link all the multidimensional clinical and laboratory information of each case, which is accomplished, optimally, using systematic and standardized operating procedures, and in the framework of multidisciplinary teams with the support of a flexible and user-friendly database system that facilitates the sharing of information of all the teams in the network. We describe a biobanking system that is a platform for discovery research at the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at the University of Pennsylvania.},

	Abstract = {Multiple techniques for quantification of hippocampal subfields from in vivo MRI have been proposed. Linking in vivo MRI to the underlying histology can help validate and improve these techniques. High-resolution ex vivo MRI can provide an intermediate modality to map information between these very different imaging modalities. This article evaluates the ability to match information between in vivo and ex vivo MRI in the same subjects. We perform rigid and deformable registration on 10 pairs of in vivo (3 T, 0.4 × 0.4 × 2.6 mm3) and ex vivo (9.4 T, 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm3) scans, and describe differences in MRI appearance between these modalities qualitatively and quantitatively. The feasibility of using this dataset to validate in vivo segmentation is evaluated by applying an automatic hippocampal subfield segmentation technique (ASHS) to in vivo scans and comparing SRLM (stratum/radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare) surface to manual tracing on corresponding ex vivo scans (and in 2 cases, histology). Regional increases in thickness are detected in ex vivo scans adjacent to the ventricles and were not related to scanner, resolution differences, or susceptibility artefacts. Satisfactory in vivo/ex vivo registration and subvoxel accuracy of ASHS segmentation of hippocampal SRLM demonstrate the feasibility of using this dataset for validation, and potentially, improvement of in vivo segmentation methods.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medical Image segmentation is an important image processing step. Comparing images to evaluate the quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in evaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain metrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of support for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics.
RESULT: First we present an overview of 20 evaluation metrics selected based on a comprehensive literature review. For fuzzy segmentation, which shows the level of membership of each voxel to multiple classes, fuzzy definitions of all metrics are provided. We present a discussion about metric properties to provide a guide for selecting evaluation metrics. Finally, we propose an efficient evaluation tool implementing the 20 selected metrics. The tool is optimized to perform efficiently in terms of speed and required memory, also if the image size is extremely large as in the case of whole body MRI or CT volume segmentation. An implementation of this tool is available as an open source project.
CONCLUSION: We propose an efficient evaluation tool for 3D medical image segmentation using 20 evaluation metrics and provide guidelines for selecting a subset of these metrics that is suitable for the data and the segmentation task.},

Curved multiplanar reformatting (CMPR) is an image reconstruction method that can improve visualization of complex three-dimensional structures. The objective of this study was to determine whether CMPR could facilitate visualization of the human hippocampal anatomy along the entire caudal-rostral axis. CMPR was applied to high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging acquired ex vivo on four cadaveric hippocampal specimens at 4.7 T (T2-weighted, 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm3 ). CMPR provided clear visualization of the classic "interlocking C" appearance of the dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis along the entire caudal-rostral axis including the head and tail, which otherwise show complex anatomy on the standard coronal slices. CMPR facilitated visualization of hippocampal anatomy providing the impetus to develop simplified approaches to delineate subfields along the entire hippocampus including the usually neglected head and tail.},

	Abstract = {Introduction: Advanced machine learning methods might help to identify dementia risk from neuroimaging, but their accuracy to date is unclear.
Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for machine learning studies differentiating healthy aging from dementia of various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different disease boundaries.
Results: Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease versus healthy controls, using AD Neuroimaging Initiative data, support vector machines, and only T1-weighted sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls and poor for differentiating healthy controls versus mild cognitive impairment versus Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment converters versus nonconverters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by data source, sample size, or machine learning method.
Discussion: Machine learning does not differentiate clinically relevant disease categories yet. More diverse data sets, combinations of different types of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to advance the field.},

	Abstract = {The measurement of the volume of the human amygdala in vivo has received increasing attention over the past decade, but existing methods face several challenges. First, due to the amorphous appearance of the amygdala and the difficulties in interpreting its boundaries, it is common for protocols to omit sizable sections of the rostral and dorsal regions of the amygdala comprising parts of the basolateral complex (BL) and central nucleus (Ce), respectively. Second, segmentation of the amgydaloid complex into separate subdivisions is challenging due to the resolution of routinely acquired images and the lack of standard protocols. Recent advances in technology have made ultra-high resolution MR images available, and in this study we provide a detailed segmentation protocol for manually tracing the whole amygdala that incorporates a greater portion of the rostral and dorsal sections with techniques illustrated in detail to maximize reproducibility. In addition, we propose a geometrically-based protocol for segmenting the amygdala into four component subregions of interest (sROI), which correspond largely to amygdala subnuclear divisions: the BL sROI, centromedial (CM) sROI, basomedial (BM) sROI, and the amygdaloid cortical (ACo) sROI. We performed an intra- and inter-rater reliability study of our methods in 10 adults (5 young adults and 5 older adults). The results indicate that both protocols can be implemented with a high degree of reliability (the majority of intra-rater and inter-rater correlations were > 0.81). This protocol should aid further research into the alterations in amygdala anatomy, connectivity, and function that accompany normal aging and pathology associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	Abstract = {ITK-SNAP is an interactive software tool for manual and semi-automatic segmentation of 3D medical images. This paper summarizes major new features added to ITK-SNAP over the last decade. The main focus of the paper is on new features that support semi-automatic segmentation of multi-modality imaging datasets, such as MRI scans acquired using different contrast mechanisms (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR). The new functionality uses decision forest classifiers trained interactively by the user to transform multiple input image volumes into a foreground/background probability map; this map is then input as the data term to the active contour evolution algorithm, which yields regularized surface representations of the segmented objects of interest. The new functionality is evaluated in the context of high-grade and low-grade glioma segmentation by three expert neuroradiogists and a non-expert on a reference dataset from the MICCAI 2013 Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATS). The accuracy of semi-automatic segmentation is competitive with the top specialized brain tumor segmentation methods evaluated in the BRATS challenge, with most results obtained in ITK-SNAP being more accurate, relative to the BRATS reference manual segmentation, than the second-best performer in the BRATS challenge; and all results being more accurate than the fourth-best performer. Segmentation time is reduced over manual segmentation by 2.5 and 5 times, depending on the rater. Additional experiments in interactive placenta segmentation in 3D fetal ultrasound illustrate the generalizability of the new functionality to a different problem domain.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in MRI and increasing knowledge on the characterization and anatomical variability of medial temporal lobe (MTL) anatomy have paved the way for more specific subdivisions of the MTL in humans. In addition, recent studies suggest that early changes in many neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases are better detected in smaller subregions of the MTL rather than with whole structure analyses. Here, we developed a new protocol using 7 Tesla (T) MRI incorporating novel anatomical findings for the manual segmentation of entorhinal cortex (ErC), perirhinal cortex (PrC; divided into area 35 and 36), parahippocampal cortex (PhC), and hippocampus; which includes the subfields subiculum (Sub), CA1, CA2, as well as CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) which are separated by the endfolial pathway covering most of the long axis of the hippocampus. We provide detailed instructions alongside slice-by-slice segmentations to ease learning for the untrained but also more experienced raters. Twenty-two subjects were scanned (19-32 yrs, mean age = 26 years, 12 females) with a turbo spin echo (TSE) T2-weighted MRI sequence with high-resolution oblique coronal slices oriented orthogonal to the long axis of the hippocampus (in-plane resolution 0.44 × 0.44 mm2) and 1.0 mm slice thickness. The scans were manually delineated by two experienced raters, to assess intra- and inter-rater reliability. The Dice Similarity Index (DSI) was above 0.78 for all regions and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) were between 0.76 to 0.99 both for intra- and inter-rater reliability. In conclusion, this study presents a fine-grained and comprehensive segmentation protocol for MTL structures at 7 T MRI that closely follows recent knowledge from anatomical studies. More specific subdivisions (e.g. area 35 and 36 in PrC, and the separation of DG and CA3) may pave the way for more precise delineations thereby enabling the detection of early volumetric changes in dementia and neuropsychiatric diseases.},

	Abstract = {Objective: Subfield-specific measurements provide superior information in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases compared to global hippocampal measurements. The overall goal was to systematically compare the performance of five representative manual and automated T1 and T2 based subfield labeling techniques in a sub-set of the ADNI2 population.
Methods: The high resolution T2 weighted hippocampal images (T2-HighRes) and the corresponding T1 images from 106 ADNI2 subjects (41 controls, 57 MCI, 8 AD) were processed as follows. A. T1-based: 1. Freesurfer + Large-Diffeomorphic-Metric-Mapping in combination with shape analysis. 2. FreeSurfer 5.1 subfields using in-vivo atlas. B. T2-HighRes: 1. Model-based subfield segmentation using ex-vivo atlas (FreeSurfer 6.0). 2. T2-based automated multi-atlas segmentation combined with similarity-weighted voting (ASHS). 3. Manual subfield parcellation. Multiple regression analyses were used to calculate effect sizes (ES) for group, amyloid positivity in controls, and associations with cognitive/memory performance for each approach.
Results: Subfield volumetry was better than whole hippocampal volumetry for the detection of the mild atrophy differences between controls and MCI (ES: 0.27 vs 0.11). T2-HighRes approaches outperformed T1 approaches for the detection of early stage atrophy (ES: 0.27 vs.0.10), amyloid positivity (ES: 0.11 vs 0.04), and cognitive associations (ES: 0.22 vs 0.19).
Conclusions: T2-HighRes subfield approaches outperformed whole hippocampus and T1 subfield approaches. None of the different T2-HghRes methods tested had a clear advantage over the other methods. Each has strengths and weaknesses that need to be taken into account when deciding which one to use to get the best results from subfield volumetry.},

	Abstract = {This study examines the atrophy rates of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to controls in four regions within the medial temporal lobe: the transentorhinal cortex (TEC), entorhinal cortex (ERC), hippocampus, and amygdala. These regions were manually segmented and then corrected for undesirable longitudinal variability via Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) based longitudinal diffeomorphometry. Diffeomorphometry techniques were used to compare thickness measurements in the TEC with the ERC. There were more significant changes in thickness atrophy rate in the TEC than medial regions of the entorhinal cortex. Volume measures were also calculated for all four regions. Classifiers were constructed using linear discriminant analysis to demonstrate that average thickness and atrophy rate of TEC together was the most discriminating measure compared to the thickness and volume measures in the areas examined, in differentiating MCI from controls. These findings are consistent with autopsy findings demonstrating that initial neuronal changes are found in TEC before spreading more medially in the ERC and to other regions in the medial temporal lobe. These findings suggest that the TEC thickness could serve as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease in the prodromal phase of the disease.},

Forty community-dwelling older adults were categorized based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance. Total gray/white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and white matter hyperintensity load were quantified from whole-brain T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging scans, whereas hippocampal subfields and MTL cortical subregion volumes (CA1, dentate gyrus/CA2/3, subiculum, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices) were quantified using high-resolution T2-weighted scans. Cognitive status was evaluated using standard neuropsychological assessments. No significant differences were found in the whole-brain measures. However, MTL volumetry revealed that anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alERC) volume-the same region in which Alzheimer's pathology originates-was strongly associated with MoCA performance. This is the first study to demonstrate that alERC volume is related to cognitive decline in undiagnosed community-dwelling older adults.},

We used [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PiB positron emission tomography, structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessment to investigate how in vivo tau accumulation in temporal lobe regions, Aβ, and MTL atrophy contribute to episodic memory in cognitively normal older adults (n = 83; age, 77 $\pm$ 6 years; 58% female). Stepwise regressions identified tau in MTL regions known to be affected in old age as the best predictor of episodic-memory performance independent of Aβ status. There was no interactive effect of MTL tau with Aβ on memory. Higher MTL tau was related to higher age in the subjects without evidence of Aβ. Among temporal lobe subregions, episodic memory was most strongly related to tau-tracer uptake in the parahippocampal gyrus, particularly the posterior entorhinal cortex, which in our parcellation includes the transentorhinal cortex. In subjects with longitudinal MRI and cognitive data (n = 57), entorhinal atrophy mirrored patterns of tau pathology and their relationship with memory decline. Our data are consistent with neuropathological studies and further suggest that entorhinal tau pathology underlies memory decline in old age even without Aβ.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Tau tangles and β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques are key lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but both pathologies also occur in cognitively normal older people. Neuropathological data indicate that tau tangles in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) underlie episodic-memory impairments in AD dementia. However, it remains unclear whether MTL tau pathology also accounts for memory impairments often seen in elderly people and how Aβ affects this relationship. Using tau-specific and Aβ-specific positron emission tomography tracers, we show that in vivo MTL tau pathology is associated with episodic-memory performance and MTL atrophy in cognitively normal adults, independent of Aβ. Our data point to MTL tau pathology, particularly in the entorhinal cortex, as a substrate of age-related episodic-memory loss.},

	Abstract = {We evaluate a fully automatic technique for labeling hippocampal subfields and cortical subregions in the medial temporal lobe in in vivo 3 Tesla MRI. The method performs segmentation on a T2-weighted MRI scan with 0.4 × 0.4 × 2.0 mm(3) resolution, partial brain coverage, and oblique orientation. Hippocampal subfields, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex are labeled using a pipeline that combines multi-atlas label fusion and learning-based error correction. In contrast to earlier work on automatic subfield segmentation in T2-weighted MRI [Yushkevich et al., 2010], our approach requires no manual initialization, labels hippocampal subfields over a greater anterior-posterior extent, and labels the perirhinal cortex, which is further subdivided into Brodmann areas 35 and 36. The accuracy of the automatic segmentation relative to manual segmentation is measured using cross-validation in 29 subjects from a study of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and is highest for the dentate gyrus (Dice coefficient is 0.823), CA1 (0.803), perirhinal cortex (0.797), and entorhinal cortex (0.786) labels. A larger cohort of 83 subjects is used to examine the effects of aMCI in the hippocampal region using both subfield volume and regional subfield thickness maps. Most significant differences between aMCI and healthy aging are observed bilaterally in the CA1 subfield and in the left Brodmann area 35. Thickness analysis results are consistent with volumetry, but provide additional regional specificity and suggest nonuniformity in the effects of aMCI on hippocampal subfields and MTL cortical subregions.},

	Abstract = {Autopsy studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have found that neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) demonstrates selective topography with relatively stereotyped subregional involvement at early disease stages, prompting interest in more granular measurement of these structures with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging. We applied a novel, automated method for measurement of hippocampal subfields and extrahippocampal MTL cortical regions. The cohort included cognitively normal (CN) adults (n = 86), early mild cognitive impairment (n = 43), late MCI (n = 22), and mild AD (n = 40) patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For pseudolongitudinal analysis of the continuum from preclinical to mild AD dementia, the groups were further divided according to amyloid status based on positron emission tomography. Specific subregions associated with the early NFT pathology of AD were more sensitive to preclinical and early prodromal AD than whole hippocampal volume while more diffuse involvement was found in later stages. In particular, BA35, the first region associated with NFT deposition, was the only region to discriminate preclinical AD from amyloid negative cognitively normal adults ("normal aging"). In general, patterns of atrophy in the pseudolongitudinal analysis largely recapitulated Braak staging of NFTs within the MTL.},

	Abstract = {RATIONAL: The human perirhinal cortex (PRC) plays critical roles in episodic and semantic memory and visual perception. The PRC consists of Brodmann areas 35 and 36 (BA35, BA36). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), BA35 is the first cortical site affected by neurofibrillary tangle pathology, which is closely linked to neural injury in AD. Large anatomical variability, manifested in the form of different cortical folding and branching patterns, makes it difficult to segment the PRC in MRI scans. Pathology studies have found that in ~97% of specimens, the PRC falls into one of three discrete anatomical variants. However, current methods for PRC segmentation and morphometry in MRI are based on single-template approaches, which may not be able to accurately model these discrete variants METHODS: A multi-template analysis pipeline that explicitly accounts for anatomical variability is used to automatically label the PRC and measure its thickness in T2-weighted MRI scans. The pipeline uses multi-atlas segmentation to automatically label medial temporal lobe cortices including entorhinal cortex, PRC and the parahippocampal cortex. Pairwise registration between label maps and clustering based on residual dissimilarity after registration are used to construct separate templates for the anatomical variants of the PRC. An optimal path of deformations linking these templates is used to establish correspondences between all the subjects. Experimental evaluation focuses on the ability of single-template and multi-template analyses to detect differences in the thickness of medial temporal lobe cortices between patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n=41) and age-matched controls (n=44).
RESULTS: The proposed technique is able to generate templates that recover the three dominant discrete variants of PRC and establish more meaningful correspondences between subjects than a single-template approach. The largest reduction in thickness associated with aMCI, in absolute terms, was found in left BA35 using both regional and summary thickness measures. Further, statistical maps of regional thickness difference between aMCI and controls revealed different patterns for the three anatomical variants.},

In amyloid-β positive but not amyloid-β negative individuals, we found significant correlation between 18F-AV-1451 uptake and atrophy rate that was strongest in the transentorhinal cortex, the first region with NFT pathology.

	Abstract = {We examined the relationship between in vivo estimates of tau deposition as measured by 18F-AV-1451 tau positron emission tomography imaging and cross-sectional cortical thickness, as well as rates of antecedent cortical thinning measured from magnetic resonance imaging in individuals with and without evidence of cerebral amyloid in 63 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, including 32 cognitively normal individuals (mean age 74 years), 27 patients with mild cognitive impairment (mean age 76.8 years), and 4 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (mean age 80 years). We hypothesized that structural measures would correlate with 18F-AV-1451 in a spatially local manner and that this correlation would be stronger for longitudinal compared to cross-sectional measures of cortical thickness and in those with cerebral amyloid versus those without. Cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of voxelwise atrophy were made from whole brain maps of cortical thickness and rates of thickness change. In amyloid-β-positive individuals, the correlation of voxelwise atrophy across the whole brain with a summary measure of medial temporal lobe (MTL) 18F-AV-1451 uptake demonstrated strong local correlations in the MTL with longitudinal atrophy that was weaker in cross-sectional analysis. Similar effects were seen in correlations between 31 bilateral cortical regions of interest. In addition, several nonlocal correlations between atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake were observed, including association between MTL atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake in parietal lobe regions of interest such as the precuneus. Amyloid-β-negative individuals only showed weaker correlations in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons. While these data replicate previous reports of associations between 18F-AV-1451 uptake and cross-sectional structural measures, the current results demonstrate a strong relationship with longitudinal measures of atrophy. These data support the notion that in vivo measures of tau pathology are tightly linked to the rate of neurodegenerative change.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is unclear the degree to which tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) measured by 18F-flortaucipir positron emission tomography relates to MTL subregional atrophy and whether this relationship differs between amyloid-β-positive and amyloid-β-negative individuals.
METHODS: We analyzed correlation of MTL 18F-flortaucipir uptake with MTL subregional atrophy measured with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging in a region of interest and regional thickness analysis and determined the relationship between memory performance and positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging measures.
RESULTS: Both groups showed strong correlations between 18F-flortaucipir uptake and atrophy, with similar spatial patterns. Effects in the rhinal cortex recapitulated Braak staging. Correlations of memory recall with atrophy and tracer uptake were observed.
DISCUSSION: Correlation patterns between tau burden and atrophy in the amyloid-β-negative group mimicking early Braak stages suggests that 18F-flortaucipir is sensitive to tau pathology in primary age-related tauopathy. Correlations of imaging measures with memory performance indicate that this pathology is associated with poorer cognition.},

	Abstract = {Clinicopathologic correlation studies are critically important for the field of Alzheimer disease (AD) research. Studies on human subjects with autopsy confirmation entail numerous potential biases that affect both their general applicability and the validity of the correlations. Many sources of data variability can weaken the apparent correlation between cognitive status and AD neuropathologic changes. Indeed, most persons in advanced old age have significant non-AD brain lesions that may alter cognition independently of AD. Worldwide research efforts have evaluated thousands of human subjects to assess the causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly, and these studies have been interpreted in different ways. We review the literature focusing on the correlation of AD neuropathologic changes (i.e. β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) with cognitive impairment. We discuss the various patterns of brain changes that have been observed in elderly individuals to provide a perspective for understanding AD clinicopathologic correlation and conclude that evidence from many independent research centers strongly supports the existence of a specific disease, as defined by the presence of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Although Aβ plaques may play a key role in AD pathogenesis, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates best with the burden of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles.},

	Abstract = {Recent stereological studies documented a severe loss of hippocampal neurons in end-stage Alzheimer's disease. The development of the disease, however, is progressive and slow, over clinically inconspicuous decades. The Braak-staging system distinguishes six histopathological stages some of which are not accompanied by clinical symptoms. We analyzed hippocampal cell loss in correlation to Braak stages. Neuron numbers were determined with unbiased stereological principles in a defined subportion of the hippocampus of 28 subjects. There were no age-dependent neuronal losses in any of the hippocampal subdivisions examined. Compared to stage I, pyramidal cell loss in CA1 was reduced by 33% in stage IV ( P<0.02) and by 51% in stage V ( P<0.0002). In the subiculum, considerable neuron loss was seen only in stage V (22%; P<0.09). Other subdivisions of the Ammon's horn showed no neuron loss. Neuron loss was greater than volume loss, e.g., neuron loss of 51% between stages I and V in CA1 was accompanied by volume loss of only 25%. Our findings indicate (i) that neuronal loss is sector and stage dependent, (ii) that neuronal loss in CA1 and the subiculum is related to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, and (iii) that neuron loss makes a weak contribution to the observed volume loss.},

	Abstract = {The National Institute on Aging Preclinical Alzheimer's disease Workgroup (PADW) has issued a preliminary report with recommendations for classifying preclinical Alzheimer's disease (pAD) according to 3 early disease stages. Here we examine the PADW recommendations in relation to neuropathological features in a large, consecutive series of cognitively intact elderly persons, autopsied within a year after cognitive testing (n = 126 cognitively intact patients with mean age 83.7 years at death). Subjects were grouped based on a hypothetical construct correlating pathological features with PADW stages. Many cognitively intact individuals were classifiable as pAD (53/126 or 43%), as expected based on epidemiological and biomarker studies. Of these, most (48%) were in "stage 3", which corresponds to amyloid pathology with early neurodegeneration. As with prior studies, our data indicate that the development of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles is the key pathological event that is not observed in pAD cases: Braak stages III or IV pathology are hence not truly a substrate for "intermediate likelihood" that cognitive impairment is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We also stress the importance of comorbid non-Alzheimer's disease brain pathologies (hippocampal sclerosis, neocortical alpha-synucleinopathy, cerebrovascular disease, and brains with hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles but no cortical amyloid plaques) that can contribute to the development of cognitive impairment, or which may serve as confounds in the application of the PADW recommendations. While the final recommendations from the PADW working group have not yet been released, this preliminary analysis provides a perspective on those recommendations from a neuropathological point of view.},

	Abstract = {TDP-43 immunoreactivity occurs in 19-57 % of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. Two patterns of TDP-43 deposition in AD have been described involving hippocampus (limbic) or hippocampus and neocortex (diffuse), although focal amygdala involvement has been observed. In 195 AD cases with TDP-43, we investigated regional TDP-43 immunoreactivity with the aim of developing a TDP-43 in AD staging scheme. TDP-43 immunoreactivity was assessed in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, hippocampal dentate gyrus, occipitotemporal, inferior temporal and frontal cortices, and basal ganglia. Clinical, neuroimaging, genetic and pathological characteristics were assessed across stages. Five stages were identified: stage I showed scant-sparse TDP-43 in the amygdala only (17 %); stage II showed moderate-frequent amygdala TDP-43 with spread into entorhinal and subiculum (25 %); stage III showed further spread into dentate gyrus and occipitotemporal cortex (31 %); stage IV showed further spread into inferior temporal cortex (20 %); and stage V showed involvement of frontal cortex and basal ganglia (7 %). Cognition and medial temporal volumes differed across all stages and progression across stages correlated with worsening cognition and medial temporal volume loss. Compared to 147 AD patients without TDP-43, only the Boston Naming Test showed abnormalities in stage I. The findings demonstrate that TDP-43 deposition in AD progresses in a stereotypic manner that can be divided into five distinct topographic stages which are supported by correlations with clinical and neuroimaging features. Given these findings, we recommend sequential regional TDP-43 screening in AD beginning with the amygdala.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) neuropathology was observed in more than 15% of aged individuals in prior studies. However, much remains unknown about the clinical correlates of HS-Aging pathology or the association(s) between HS-Aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology. Clinical and comorbid pathological features linked to HS-Aging pathology were analyzed using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) data. From autopsy data extending back to 1990 (n = 9,817 participants), the neuropathological diagnoses were evaluated from American AD Centers (ADCs). Among participants who died between 2005-2012 (n = 1,422), additional analyses identified clinical and pathological features associated with HS-Aging pathology. We also compared cognitive testing and longevity outcomes between HS-Aging cases and a subsample with non-tauopathy FTLD (n = 210). Reporting of HS-Aging pathology increased dramatically among ADCs in recent years, to nearly 20% of autopsies in 2012. Participants with relatively "pure" HS-Aging pathology were often diagnosed clinically as having probable (68%) or possible (15%) AD. However, the co-occurrence of HS-Aging pathology and AD neuropathology (AD-NP) did not indicate any pattern of correlation between the two pathologies. Compared with other pathologies, participants with HS-Aging pathology had higher overall cognitive/functional ability (versus AD-NP) and verbal fluency (versus both AD-NP and FTLD) but similar episodic memory impairment at one clinic visit 2-5 years prior to death. Patients with HS-Aging live considerably longer than patients with non-tauopathy FTLD. We conclude that the manifestations of HS-Aging, increasingly recognized in recent years, probably indicate a separate disease process of direct relevance to patient care, dementia research, and clinical trials. },

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the frequency of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) differs across pathologically defined AD subtypes (hippocampal sparing [HpSp]; typical and limbic) and further examine the relationship between TDP-43, pathological subtype, and clinical features in AD.
METHODS: We identified all cases with pathologically confirmed AD (NIA-Reagan intermediate-high probability, Braak stage IV-VI) independent of cognitive status (n = 188). Neurofibrillary tangle counts were performed using thioflavin-S microscopy in hippocampus and three neocortical regions, and all cases were subtyped: HpSp AD pathology (n = 19); typical AD pathology (n = 136); and limbic AD pathology (n = 33). TDP-43 immunoreactivity was performed in multiple brain regions to assess for the presence of TDP-43 and TDP-43 stage. All cases were clinically subclassified at presentation as amnestic AD dementia versus atypical AD dementia. Statistical analysis was performed using linear and penalized logistic regression to assess associations with pathological subtype, and the effects of TDP-43, accounting for possible interactions between pathological subtype and TDP-43.
RESULTS: TDP-43 deposition was frequent in typical (59%) and limbic AD pathologies (67%), but not HpSp AD pathology (21%; p = 0.003). The observed associations of TDP-43 with greater memory loss, naming and functional decline, and smaller hippocampal volumes, closest to death, did not differ across AD pathological subtype. Clinical presentation was associated with pathological subtype (p = 0.01), but not TDP-43 (p = 0.69).
INTERPRETATION: Although the frequency of TDP-43 deposition in AD varies by pathological subtype, the observed effects of TDP-43 on clinical/magnetic resonance imaging features are consistent across pathological subtypes. Clinical presentation in AD is driven by pathological subtype, not by TDP-43.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine whether the TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) has any independent effect on the clinical and neuroimaging features typically ascribed to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and whether TDP-43 pathology could help shed light on the phenomenon of resilient cognition in AD. Three-hundred and forty-two subjects pathologically diagnosed with AD were screened for the presence, burden and distribution of TDP-43. All had been classified as cognitively impaired or normal, prior to death. Atlas-based parcellation and voxel-based morphometry were used to assess regional atrophy on MRI. Regression models controlling for age at death, apolipoprotein ε4 and other AD-related pathologies were utilized to explore associations between TDP-43 and cognition or brain atrophy, stratified by Braak stage. In addition, we determined whether the effects of TDP-43 were mediated by hippocampal sclerosis. One-hundred and ninety-five (57%) cases were TDP-positive. After accounting for age, apolipoprotein ε4 and other pathologies, TDP-43 had a strong effect on cognition, memory loss and medial temporal atrophy in AD. These effects were not mediated by hippocampal sclerosis. TDP-positive subjects were 10× more likely to be cognitively impaired at death compared to TDP-negative subjects. Greater cognitive impairment and medial temporal atrophy were associated with greater TDP-43 burden and more extensive TDP-43 distribution. TDP-43 is an important factor in the manifestation of the clinico-imaging features of AD. TDP-43 also appears to be able to overpower what has been termed resilient brain aging. TDP-43 therefore should be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.},

	Abstract = {We describe a recently recognized disease entity, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). LATE neuropathological change (LATE-NC) is defined by a stereotypical TDP-43 proteinopathy in older adults, with or without coexisting hippocampal sclerosis pathology. LATE-NC is a common TDP-43 proteinopathy, associated with an amnestic dementia syndrome that mimicked Alzheimer's-type dementia in retrospective autopsy studies. LATE is distinguished from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology based on its epidemiology (LATE generally affects older subjects), and relatively restricted neuroanatomical distribution of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In community-based autopsy cohorts, ∼25% of brains had sufficient burden of LATE-NC to be associated with discernible cognitive impairment. Many subjects with LATE-NC have comorbid brain pathologies, often including amyloid-β plaques and tauopathy. Given that the 'oldest-old' are at greatest risk for LATE-NC, and subjects of advanced age constitute a rapidly growing demographic group in many countries, LATE has an expanding but under-recognized impact on public health. For these reasons, a working group was convened to develop diagnostic criteria for LATE, aiming both to stimulate research and to promote awareness of this pathway to dementia. We report consensus-based recommendations including guidelines for diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC. For routine autopsy workup of LATE-NC, an anatomically-based preliminary staging scheme is proposed with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on tissue from three brain areas, reflecting a hierarchical pattern of brain involvement: amygdala, hippocampus, and middle frontal gyrus. LATE-NC appears to affect the medial temporal lobe structures preferentially, but other areas also are impacted. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that subjects with LATE-NC also had atrophy in the medial temporal lobes, frontal cortex, and other brain regions. Genetic studies have thus far indicated five genes with risk alleles for LATE-NC: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE. The discovery of these genetic risk variants indicate that LATE shares pathogenetic mechanisms with both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, but also suggests disease-specific underlying mechanisms. Large gaps remain in our understanding of LATE. For advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is an urgent need for research focused on LATE, including in vitro and animal models. An obstacle to clinical progress is lack of diagnostic tools, such as biofluid or neuroimaging biomarkers, for ante-mortem detection of LATE. Development of a disease biomarker would augment observational studies seeking to further define the risk factors, natural history, and clinical features of LATE, as well as eventual subject recruitment for targeted therapies in clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {In a neuropathological study of 81 brains of prospectively studied subjects of 80 years of age or older at the time of death, 13 cases (16%), including 4 men and 9 women, had hippocampal sclerosis (HpScl) affecting the vulnerable region of the hippocampus. In demented subjects of 80 years of age or older, the frequency of HpScl was even higher, 26%. Cases with HpScl had significantly fewer hippocampal senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and parahippocampal NFT than cases without HpScl, but did not differ significantly in any of the other measured pathological parameters. Enzyme-linked analysis of synaptic protein immunoreactivity in a subset of 33 cases demonstrated significant decreases in the hippocampus, but not in frontal, temporal, parietal or parahippocampal cortices. All but 1 of the cases with HpScl had Blessed information, memory and concentration scores (BIMC) of 8 or more, and all were considered to be demented. In some patients memory disturbance was disproportionate to deficits in other cognitive areas. All but 4 of the cases with HpScl had many non-neuritic, amyloid plaques in the neocortex meeting NIA criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, given the advanced age of the subjects, amyloid plaques were considered to represent age-related cerebral amyloid deposition ("pathological aging") in most cases. Only 3 cases had both many SP and NFT in multiple cortical regions consistent with AD. Another case had brain stem and cortical Lewy bodies consistent with diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD). A few ballooned neurons were present in the limbic cortices in 3 cases, including one case of dementia with argyrophilic grains (DAG) in limbic and orbital frontal and temporal cortices. The 8 cases without AD, DLBD or DAG included 4 cases in which no other obvious cause of dementia was detected and 4 cases in which HpScl was accompanied by either multiple cerebral infarcts or leukoencephalopathy, or both, that could have contributed to dementia. Patients with HpScl had risk factors, clinical signs and post-mortem pathological findings of cardiovascular disease, but due to the high prevalence of these conditions in very old humans, no significant correlation with HpScl was detected. This study demonstrates that HpScl is a common post-mortem finding in demented, but not normal, elderly subjects. It may contribute to. or be a marker for, the increased risk of dementia in subjects with documented cardiovascular disease or a history of myocardial infarction.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic specificity of MRI-defined hippocampal atrophy for AD among individuals with a variety of pathologically confirmed conditions associated with dementia as well as changes attributable to typical aging, and to measure correlations among premortem MRI measurements of hippocampal atrophy, mental status examination performance, and the pathologic stage of AD.
METHODS: An unselected series of 67 individuals participating in the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center/Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry who had undergone a standardized antemortem MRI study and also postmortem examination were identified. Hippocampal volumes were measured from antemortem MRI. Each postmortem specimen was assigned a pathologic diagnosis and in addition, the severity of AD pathology was staged using the method of Braak and Braak.
RESULTS: Individuals with an isolated pathologic diagnosis of AD, hippocampal sclerosis, frontotemporal degeneration, and neurofibrillary tangle--only degeneration usually had substantial hippocampal atrophy, while those with changes of typical aging did not. Among all 67 subjects, correlations (all p < 0.001) were observed between hippocampal volume and Braak and Braak stage (r = -0.39), between hippocampal volume and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = 0.60), and between MMSE score and Braak and Braak stage (r = -0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampal atrophy, while not specific for AD, was a fairly sensitive marker of the pathologic AD stage (particularly among subjects with isolated AD pathology [r = -0.63, p = 0.001]) and consequent cognitive status.},

	Abstract = {For 11 AD cases and four normal elderly controls, post mortem volumes of the hippocampal subdivisions were calculated by using magnetic resonance imaging and histological sections. After at least six weeks of fixation in formalin, brains were examined on a 1.5-T Philips Gyroscan imager producing T1-weighted coronal images with a 3-mm slice thickness. Brains were then processed and embedded in paraffin. Serial coronal sections, 3 mm apart and stained with Cresyl Violet, were used for the planimetry and unbiased estimation of the total numbers of neurons in the hippocampal subdivisions. For all 15 cases, magnetic resonance imaging- and histology-based measurements were performed along the whole rostrocaudal extent of the hippocampal formation and included three subvolumes: (i) the hippocampus (CA1-CA4 and the dentate gyrus); (ii) hippocampus/subiculum; and (iii) hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus. After controlling for shrinkage, strong correlations were found between magnetic resonance imaging and histological measurements for the hippocampus (r = 0.97, P < 0.001), hippocampus/subiculum (r = 0.95, P < 0.001) and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus (r = 0.89, P < 0.001). We also calculated the total number of neurons in the hippocampus and hippocampus/subiculum subvolumes. Strong correlations between the magnetic resonance imaging subvolumes and neuronal counts were found for the hippocampus (r = 0.90, P < 0.001) and the hippocampus/subiculum subvolume (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). We conclude that very accurate volumetric measurements of the whole hippocampal formation can be obtained by using a magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Moreover, the strong correlations between magnetic resonance imaging-based hippocampal volumes and neuronal numbers suggest the anatomical validity of magnetic resonance imaging volume measurements.},

	Abstract = {Importance: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging now allows in vivo visualization of both neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD): amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles. Observing their progressive accumulation in the brains of clinically normal older adults is critically important to understand the pathophysiologic cascade leading to AD and to inform the choice of outcome measures in prevention trials.
Objective: To assess the associations among Aβ, tau, and cognition, measured during different observation periods for 7 years.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Prospective cohort study conducted between 2010 and 2017 at the Harvard Aging Brain Study, Boston, Massachusetts. The study enrolled 279 clinically normal participants. An additional 90 individuals were approached but declined the study or did not meet the inclusion criteria. In this report, we analyzed data from 60 participants who had multiple Aβ and tau PET observations available on October 31, 2017.
Main Outcomes and Measures: A median of 3 Pittsburgh compound B-PET (Aβ, 2010-2017) and 2 flortaucipir-PET (tau, 2013-2017) images were collected. We used initial PET and slope data, assessing the rates of change in Aβ and tau, to measure cognitive changes. Cognition was evaluated annually using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (2010-2017). Annual consensus meetings evaluated progression to mild cognitive impairment.
Results: Of the 60 participants, 35 were women (58%) and 25 were men (42%); median age at inclusion was 73 years (range, 65-85 years). Seventeen participants (28%) exhibited an initial high Aβ burden. An antecedent rise in Aβ was associated with subsequent changes in tau (1.07 flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios [SUVr]/PiB-SUVr; 95% CI, 0.13-3.46; P = .02). Tau changes were associated with cognitive changes (-3.28 z scores/SUVR; 95% CI, -6.67 to -0.91; P = .001), covarying baseline Aβ and tau. Tau changes were greater in the participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (n = 6) than in those who did not (n = 11; 0.05 SUVr per year; 95% CI, 0.03-0.07; P = .001). A serial mediation model demonstrated that the association between initial Aβ and final cognition, measured 7 years later, was mediated by successive changes in Aβ and tau.
Conclusions and Relevance: We identified sequential changes in normal older adults, from Aβ to tau to cognition, after which the participants with high Aβ with greater tau increase met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment. These findings highlight the importance of repeated tau-PET observations to track disease progression and the importance of repeated amyloid-PET observations to detect the earliest AD pathologic changes.},

	Abstract = {The advent of tau-targeted PET tracers such as flortaucipir (18F) (flortaucipir, also known as 18F-AV-1451 or 18F-T807) have made it possible to investigate the sequence of development of tau in relationship to age, amyloid-β, and to the development of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Here we report a multicentre longitudinal evaluation of the relationships between baseline tau, tau change and cognitive change, using flortaucipir PET imaging. A total of 202 participants 50 years old or older, including 57 cognitively normal subjects, 97 clinically defined mild cognitive impairment and 48 possible or probable Alzheimer's disease dementia patients, received flortaucipir PET scans of 20 min in duration beginning 80 min after intravenous administration of 370 MBq flortaucipir (18F). On separate days, subjects also received florbetapir amyloid PET imaging, and underwent a neuropsychological test battery. Follow-up flortaucipir scans and neuropsychological battery assessments were also performed at 9 and 18 months. Fifty-five amyloid-β+ and 90 amyloid-β- subjects completed the baseline and 18-month study visits and had valid quantifiable flortaucipir scans at both time points. There was a statistically significant increase in the global estimate of cortical tau burden as measured by standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) from baseline to 18 months in amyloid-β+ but not amyloid-β- subjects (least squared mean change in flortaucipir SUVr : 0.0524 $\pm$ 0.0085, P < 0.0001 and 0.0007 $\pm$ 0.0024 P = 0.7850, respectively), and a significant association between magnitude of SUVr increase and baseline tau burden. Voxel-wise evaluations further suggested that the regional pattern of change in flortaucipir PET SUVr over the 18-month study period (i.e. which regions exhibited the greatest change) also varied as a function of baseline global estimate of tau burden. In subjects with lower global SUVr, temporal lobe regions showed the greatest flortaucipir retention, whereas in subjects with higher baseline SUVr, parietal and frontal regions were increasingly affected. Finally, baseline flortaucipir and change in flortaucipir SUVr were both significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with changes in cognitive performance. Taken together, these results provide a preliminary characterization of the longitudinal spread of tau in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that the amount and location of tau may have implications both for the spread of tau and the cognitive deterioration that may occur over an 18-month period.},

	Abstract = {See Hansson and Mormino (doi:10.1093/brain/awy065) for a scientific commentary on this article.Our objective was to compare different whole-brain and region-specific measurements of within-person change on serial tau PET and evaluate its utility for clinical trials. We studied 126 individuals: 59 cognitively unimpaired with normal amyloid, 37 cognitively unimpaired with abnormal amyloid, and 30 cognitively impaired with an amnestic phenotype and abnormal amyloid. All had baseline amyloid PET and two tau PET, MRI, and clinical assessments. We compared the topography across all cortical regions of interest of tau PET accumulation rates and the rates of four different whole-brain or region-specific meta-regions of interest among the three clinical groups. We computed sample size estimates for change in tau PET, cortical volume, and memory/mental status indices for use as outcome measures in clinical trials. The cognitively unimpaired normal amyloid group had no observable tau accumulation throughout the brain. Tau accumulation rates in cognitively unimpaired abnormal amyloid were low [0.006 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), 0.5%, per year] but greater than rates in the cognitively unimpaired normal amyloid group in the basal and mid-temporal, retrosplenial, posterior cingulate, and entorhinal regions of interest. Thus, the earliest elevation in accumulation rates was widespread and not confined to the entorhinal cortex. Tau accumulation rates in the cognitively impaired abnormal amyloid group were 0.053 SUVR (3%) per year and greater than rates in cognitively unimpaired abnormal amyloid in all cortical areas except medial temporal. Rates of accumulation in the four meta-regions of interest differed but only slightly from one another. Among all tau PET meta-regions of interest, sample size estimates were smallest for a temporal lobe composite within cognitively unimpaired abnormal amyloid and for the late Alzheimer's disease meta-region of interest within cognitively impaired abnormal amyloid. The ordering of the sample size estimates by outcome measure was MRI < tau PET < cognitive measures. At a group-wise level, observable rates of short-term serial tau accumulation were only seen in the presence of abnormal amyloid. As disease progressed to clinically symptomatic stages (cognitively impaired abnormal amyloid), observable rates of tau accumulation were seen uniformly throughout the brain providing evidence that tau does not accumulate in one area at a time or in start-stop, stepwise sequence. The information captured by rate measures in different meta-regions of interest, even those with little topographic overlap, was similar. The implication is that rate measurements from simple meta-regions of interest, without the need for Braak-like staging, may be sufficient to capture progressive within-person accumulation of pathologic tau. Tau PET SUVR measures should be an efficient outcome measure in disease-modifying clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {Technologies for imaging the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) now permit studies of the relationships between the two major proteins deposited in this disease - amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau - and their effects on measures of neurodegeneration and cognition in humans. Deposition of Aβ in the medial parietal cortex appears to be the first stage in the development of AD, although tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) precede Aβ deposition in cognitively healthy older people. Whether aggregation of tau in the MTL is the first stage in AD or a fairly benign phenomenon that may be transformed and spread in the presence of Aβ is a major unresolved question. Despite a strong link between Aβ and tau, the relationship between Aβ and neurodegeneration is weak; rather, it is tau that is associated with brain atrophy and hypometabolism, which, in turn, are related to cognition. Although there is support for an interaction between Aβ and tau resulting in neurodegeneration that leads to dementia, the unknown nature of this interaction, the strikingly different patterns of brain Aβ and tau deposition and the appearance of neurodegeneration in the absence of Aβ and tau are challenges to this model that ultimately must be explained.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Diagnosis of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) still relies on post-mortem examination of the human brain. A non-invasive method of determining brain tau burden in vivo would allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of tauopathies. The purpose of the study was to evaluate (18)F-THK523 as a potential tau imaging tracer.
METHODS: Ten healthy elderly controls, three semantic dementia (SD) and ten AD patients underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI as well as (18)F-THK523 and (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Composite memory and non-memory scores, global and hippocampal brain volume, and partial volume-corrected tissue ratios for (18)F-THK523 and (11)C-PIB were estimated for all participants. Correlational analyses were performed between global and regional (18)F-THK523, (11)C-PIB, cognition and brain volumetrics.
RESULTS: (18)F-THK523 presented with fast reversible kinetics. Significantly higher (18)F-THK523 retention was observed in the temporal, parietal, orbitofrontal and hippocampi of AD patients when compared to healthy controls and SD patients. White matter retention was significantly higher than grey matter retention in all participants. The pattern of cortical (18)F-THK523 retention did not correlate with Aβ distribution as assessed by (11)C-PIB and followed the known distribution of tau in the AD brain, being higher in temporal and parietal areas than in the frontal region. Unlike (11)C-PIB, hippocampal (18)F-THK523 retention was correlated with several cognitive parameters and with hippocampal atrophy.
CONCLUSION: (18)F-THK523 does not bind to Aβ in vivo, while following the known distribution of paired helical filaments (PHF)-tau in the brain. Significantly higher cortical (18)F-THK523 retention in AD patients as well as the association of hippocampal (18)F-THK523 retention with cognitive parameters and hippocampal volume suggests (18)F-THK523 selectively binds to tau in AD patients. Unfortunately, the very high (18)F-THK523 retention in white matter precludes simple visual inspection of the images, preventing its use in research or clinical settings.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging agents capable of quantifying the brain's tau aggregates will allow a more precise staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to examine the in vitro properties as well as the in vivo kinetics, using gold standard methods, of the novel positron emission tomography (PET) tau imaging agent [18F]MK-6240.
METHODS: In vitro properties of [18F]MK-6240 were estimated with autoradiography in postmortem brain tissues of 14 subjects (seven AD patients and seven age-matched controls). In vivo quantification of [18F]MK-6240 binding was performed in 16 subjects (four AD patients, three mild cognitive impairment patients, six healthy elderly individuals, and three healthy young individuals) who underwent 180-min dynamic scans; six subjects had arterial sampling for metabolite correction. Simplified approaches for [18F]MK-6240 quantification were validated using full kinetic modeling with metabolite-corrected arterial input function. All participants also underwent amyloid-PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: In vitro [18F]MK-6240 uptake was higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls in brain regions expected to contain tangles such as the hippocampus, whereas no difference was found in the cerebellar gray matter. In vivo, [18F]MK-6240 displayed favorable kinetics with rapid brain delivery and washout. The cerebellar gray matter had low binding across individuals, showing potential for use as a reference region. A reversible two-tissue compartment model well described the time-activity curves across individuals and brain regions. Distribution volume ratios using the plasma input and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) calculated after the binding approached equilibrium (90 min) were correlated and higher in mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia patients than in controls. Reliability analysis revealed robust SUVRs calculated from 90 to 110 min, while earlier time points provided inaccurate estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation shows an [18F]MK-6240 distribution in concordance with postmortem studies and that simplified quantitative approaches such as the SUVR offer valid estimates of neurofibrillary tangle load 90 min post injection. [18F]MK-6240 is a promising tau tracer with the potential to be applied in the disease diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic interventions.},

	Abstract = {Aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) into oligomers, fibrils, and plaques is central in the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is the main focus of AD drug development. Biomarkers to monitor Aβ metabolism and aggregation directly in patients are important for further detailed study of the involvement of Aβ in disease pathogenesis and to monitor the biochemical effect of drugs targeting Aβ in clinical trials. Furthermore, if anti-Aβ disease-modifying drugs prove to be effective clinically, amyloid biomarkers will be of special value in the clinic to identify patients with brain amyloid deposition at risk for progression to AD dementia, to enable initiation of treatment before neurodegeneration is too severe, and to monitor drug effects on Aβ metabolism or pathology to guide dosage. Two types of amyloid biomarker have been developed: Aβ-binding ligands for use in positron emission tomography (PET) and assays to measure Aβ42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this review, we present the rationales behind these biomarkers and compare their ability to measure Aβ plaque load in the brain. We also review possible shortcomings and the need of standardization of both biomarkers, as well as their implementation in the clinic. },

	Abstract = {The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) binds with high affinity to beta-pleated sheet aggregates of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in vitro. The in vivo retention of PiB in brains of people with Alzheimer's disease shows a regional distribution that is very similar to distribution of Abeta deposits observed post-mortem. However, the basis for regional variations in PiB binding in vivo, and the extent to which it binds to different types of Abeta-containing plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined 28 clinically diagnosed and autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease subjects, including one Alzheimer's disease subject who had undergone PiB-PET imaging 10 months prior to death, to evaluate region- and substrate-specific binding of the highly fluorescent PiB derivative 6-CN-PiB. These data were then correlated with region-matched Abeta plaque load and peptide levels, [(3)H]PiB binding in vitro, and in vivo PET retention levels. We found that in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue sections, the preponderance of 6-CN-PiB binding is in plaques immunoreactive to either Abeta42 or Abeta40, and to vascular Abeta deposits. 6-CN-PiB labelling was most robust in compact/cored plaques in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. While diffuse plaques, including those in caudate nucleus and presubiculum, were less prominently labelled, amorphous Abeta plaques in the cerebellum were not detectable with 6-CN-PiB. Only a small subset of NFT were 6-CN-PiB positive; these resembled extracellular 'ghost' NFT. In Alzheimer's disease brain tissue homogenates, there was a direct correlation between [(3)H]PiB binding and insoluble Abeta peptide levels. In the Alzheimer's disease subject who underwent PiB-PET prior to death, in vivo PiB retention levels correlated directly with region-matched post-mortem measures of [(3)H]PiB binding, insoluble Abeta peptide levels, 6-CN-PiB- and Abeta plaque load, but not with measures of NFT. These results demonstrate, in a typical Alzheimer's disease brain, that PiB binding is highly selective for insoluble (fibrillar) Abeta deposits, and not for neurofibrillary pathology. The strong direct correlation of in vivo PiB retention with region-matched quantitative analyses of Abeta plaques in the same subject supports the validity of PiB-PET imaging as a method for in vivo evaluation of Abeta plaque burden.},

Thanks to evolving biomarker research and substantial discoveries, it is now possible to identify the disease even at the preclinical stage before the occurrence of the first clinical symptoms. This preclinical stage of AD has become a major research focus as the field postulates that early intervention may offer the best chance of therapeutic success. To date, very little evidence is established on this "silent" stage of the disease. A clarification is needed about the definitions and lexicon, the limits, the natural history, the markers of progression, and the ethical consequence of detecting the disease at this asymptomatic stage. This article is aimed at addressing all the different issues by providing for each of them an updated review of the literature and evidence, with practical recommendations. },

	Abstract = {In 2011, the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association created separate diagnostic recommendations for the preclinical, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages of Alzheimer's disease. Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a "research framework" because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of dementia-related neuropathologic lesions to age-related and disease-related change in cognitive function.
METHODS: A total of 354 Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers had annual clinical evaluations for up to 13 years, died, and underwent brain autopsy. The clinical evaluations included detailed testing of cognitive function from which previously established composite measures of global cognition and specific cognitive functions were derived. As part of a uniform neuropathologic evaluation, the density of neurofibrillary tangles was summarized in a composite measure and the presence of Lewy bodies and gross and microscopic cerebral infarction was noted.
RESULTS: During follow-up, rate of global cognitive decline was gradual at first and then more than quadrupled in the last 4 to 5 years of life consistent with the onset of progressive dementia. Neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral infarction, and neocortical Lewy bodies all contributed to gradual age-related cognitive decline and little age-related decline was evident in the absence of these lesions. Neurofibrillary tangles and neocortical Lewy bodies contributed to precipitous disease-related cognitive decline, but substantial disease-related decline was evident even in the absence of these lesions.
CONCLUSION: Mild age-related decline in cognitive function is mainly due to the neuropathologic lesions traditionally associated with dementia.},

@article{donohue14,
	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: As Alzheimer disease (AD) research moves to intervene in presymptomatic phases of the disease, we must develop outcome measures sensitive to the earliest disease-related changes.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the 2 studies that collected data on Aβ levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD "Aβ-positive" placebo group and compare them with an "Aβ-negative" group. For the study that did not include data on Aβ levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-ε4 and by clinical progression.
RESULTS: In ADNI, Aβ-positive participants showed more decline than did Aβ-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95% CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; P = .02). In AIBL, the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95% CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95% CI, -2.290 to -0.519]; P = .002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-ε4 allele carriers performed significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 [0.294] [95% CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95% CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; P = .001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95% CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; P < .001). Using pilot estimates of variance and assuming 500 participants per group with 30% attrition and a 5% α level, we project 80% power to detect effects in the range of Δ = 0.467 to 0.733 on the ADCS-PACC.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary prevention trials.},

	Abstract = {Importance: Among cognitively normal individuals, elevated brain amyloid (defined by cerebrospinal fluid assays or positron emission tomography regional summaries) can be related to risk for later Alzheimer-related cognitive decline.
Objective: To characterize and quantify the risk for Alzheimer-related cognitive decline among cognitively normal individuals with elevated brain amyloid.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Exploratory analyses were conducted with longitudinal cognitive and biomarker data from 445 cognitively normal individuals in the United States and Canada. Participants were observed from August 23, 2005, to June 7, 2016, for a median of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 2.0-4.2 years; maximum follow-up, 10.3 years) as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
Exposures: Individuals were classified at baseline as having normal (n = 243) or elevated (n = 202) brain amyloid using positron emission tomography amyloid imaging or a cerebrospinal fluid assay of amyloid β.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included scores on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; a sum of 4 baseline standardized z scores, which decreases with worse performance), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 0 [worst] to 30 [best] points), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum of Boxes; 0 [best] to 18 [worst] points), and Logical Memory Delayed Recall (0 [worst] to 25 [best] story units).
Results: Among the 445 participants (243 with normal amyloid, 202 with elevated amyloid), mean (SD) age was 74.0 (5.9) years, mean education was 16.4 (2.7) years, and 52% were women. The mean score for PACC at baseline was 0.00 (2.60); for MMSE, 29.0 (1.2); for CDR-Sum of Boxes, 0.04 (0.14); and for Logical Memory Delayed Recall, 13.1 (3.3). Compared with the group with normal amyloid, those with elevated amyloid had worse mean scores at 4 years on the PACC (mean difference, 1.51 points [95% CI, 0.94-2.10]; P < .001), MMSE (mean difference, 0.56 points [95% CI, 0.32-0.80]; P < .001), and CDR-Sum of Boxes (mean difference, 0.23 points [95% CI, 0.08-0.38]; P = .002). For Logical Memory Delayed Recall, between-group score was not statistically significant at 4 years (mean difference, 0.73 story units [95% CI, -0.02 to 1.48]; P = .056).
Conclusions and Relevance: Exploratory analyses of a cognitively normal cohort followed up for a median of 3.1 years suggest that elevation in baseline brain amyloid level, compared with normal brain amyloid level, was associated with higher likelihood of cognitive decline, although the findings are of uncertain clinical significance. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of these differences and measure longer-term associations.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to describe the antemortem clinical and neuroimaging features among patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-TDP).
METHODS: Subjects were recruited from a consecutive series of patients with a primary neuropathologic diagnosis of FTLD-TDP and antemortem MRI. Twenty-eight patients met entry criteria: 9 with type 1, 5 with type 2, and 10 with type 3 FTLD-TDP. Four patients had too sparse FTLD-TDP pathology to be subtyped. Clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging features of these cases were reviewed. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess regional gray matter atrophy in relation to a group of 50 cognitively normal control subjects.
RESULTS: Clinical diagnosis varied between the groups: semantic dementia was only associated with type 1 pathology, whereas progressive nonfluent aphasia and corticobasal syndrome were only associated with type 3. Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease were seen in type 2 or type 3 pathology. The neuroimaging analysis revealed distinct patterns of atrophy between the pathologic subtypes: type 1 was associated with asymmetric anterior temporal lobe atrophy (either left- or right-predominant) with involvement also of the orbitofrontal lobes and insulae; type 2 with relatively symmetric atrophy of the medial temporal, medial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal-insular cortices; and type 3 with asymmetric atrophy (either left- or right-predominant) involving more dorsal areas including frontal, temporal, and inferior parietal cortices as well as striatum and thalamus. No significant atrophy was seen among patients with too sparse pathology to be subtyped.
CONCLUSIONS: FTLD-TDP subtypes have distinct clinical and neuroimaging features, highlighting the relevance of FTLD-TDP subtyping to clinicopathologic correlation.},

	Abstract = {Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are types of major TDP-43 (43-kDa TAR DNA-binding protein) proteinopathy. Cortical TDP-43 pathology has been analyzed in detail in cases of FTLD-TDP, but is still unclear in cases of ALS. We attempted to clarify the cortical and subcortical TDP-43 pathology in Japanese cases of sporadic ALS (n = 96) using an antibody specific to phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43). The cases were divided into two groups: those without pTDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions in the hippocampal dentate granule cells (Type 1, n = 63), and those with such inclusions (Type 2, n = 33). Furthermore, the Type 2 cases were divided into two subgroups based on semi-quantitative estimation of pTDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites (DNs) in the temporal neocortex: Type 2a (accompanied by no or few DNs, n = 22) and Type 2b (accompanied by abundant DNs, n = 11). Clinico-pathologic analysis revealed that cognitive impairment was a feature in patients with Type 2a and Type 2b, but not in those with Type 1, and that importantly, Type 2b is a distinct subtype characterized by a poor prognosis despite the less severe loss of lower motor neurons, the unusual subcortical dendrospinal pTDP-43 pathology, and more prominent glial involvement in cortical pTDP-43 pathology than other two groups. Considering the patient survival time and severity of motor neuron loss in each group, transition from Type 1 to Type 2, or from Type 2a to Type 2b during the disease course appeared unlikely. Therefore, each of these three groups was regarded as an independent subtype.},

	Abstract = {Medial temporal lobe (MTL) substructures are the earliest regions affected by neurofibrillary tangle pathology-and thus are promising biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, automatic segmentation of the MTL using only T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging due to the large anatomical variability of the MTL cortex and the confound of the dura mater, which is commonly segmented as gray matter by state-of-the-art algorithms because they have similar intensity in T1w MRI. To address these challenges, we developed a novel atlas set, consisting of 15 cognitively normal older adults and 14 patients with mild cognitive impairment with a label explicitly assigned to the dura, that can be used by the multiatlas automated pipeline (Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields [ASHS-T1]) for the segmentation of MTL subregions, including anterior/posterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, and parahippocampal cortex on T1w MRI. Cross-validation experiments indicated good segmentation accuracy of ASHS-T1 and that the dura can be reliably separated from the cortex (6.5% mislabeled as gray matter). Conversely, FreeSurfer segmented majority of the dura mater (62.4%) as gray matter and the degree of dura mislabeling decreased with increasing disease severity. To evaluate its clinical utility, we applied the pipeline to T1w images of 663 ADNI subjects and significant volume/thickness loss is observed in BA35, ERC, and posterior hippocampus in early prodromal AD and all subregions at later stages. As such, the publicly available new atlas and ASHS-T1 could have important utility in the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD and enhancing brain-behavior studies of these regions.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is becoming increasingly important to study common and distinct etiologies, clinical and pathological features, and mechanisms related to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. These comparative studies rely on powerful database tools to quickly generate data sets that match diverse and complementary criteria set by them.
METHODS: In this article, we present a novel integrated neurodegenerative disease (INDD) database, which was developed at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) with the help of a consortium of Penn investigators. Because the work of these investigators are based on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, it allowed us to achieve the goal of developing an INDD database for these major neurodegenerative disorders. We used the Microsoft SQL server as a platform, with built-in "backwards" functionality to provide Access as a frontend client to interface with the database. We used PHP Hypertext Preprocessor to create the "frontend" web interface and then used a master lookup table to integrate individual neurodegenerative disease databases. We also present methods of data entry, database security, database backups, and database audit trails for this INDD database.
RESULTS: Using the INDD database, we compared the results of a biomarker study with those using an alternative approach by querying individual databases separately.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the Penn INDD database has the ability to query multiple database tables from a single console with high accuracy and reliability. The INDD database provides a powerful tool for generating data sets in comparative studies on several neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {ITK-SNAP is an interactive software tool for manual and semi-automatic segmentation of 3D medical images. This paper summarizes major new features added to ITK-SNAP over the last decade. The main focus of the paper is on new features that support semi-automatic segmentation of multi-modality imaging datasets, such as MRI scans acquired using different contrast mechanisms (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR). The new functionality uses decision forest classifiers trained interactively by the user to transform multiple input image volumes into a foreground/background probability map; this map is then input as the data term to the active contour evolution algorithm, which yields regularized surface representations of the segmented objects of interest. The new functionality is evaluated in the context of high-grade and low-grade glioma segmentation by three expert neuroradiogists and a non-expert on a reference dataset from the MICCAI 2013 Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BRATS). The accuracy of semi-automatic segmentation is competitive with the top specialized brain tumor segmentation methods evaluated in the BRATS challenge, with most results obtained in ITK-SNAP being more accurate, relative to the BRATS reference manual segmentation, than the second-best performer in the BRATS challenge; and all results being more accurate than the fourth-best performer. Segmentation time is reduced over manual segmentation by 2.5 and 5 times, depending on the rater. Additional experiments in interactive placenta segmentation in 3D fetal ultrasound illustrate the generalizability of the new functionality to a different problem domain.},

	Abstract = {Although the hippocampus is one of the most studied structures in the human brain, limited quantitative data exist on its 3D organization, anatomical variability, and effects of disease on its subregions. Histological studies provide restricted reference information due to their 2D nature. In this paper, high-resolution (∼200 × 200 × 200 μm3) ex vivo MRI scans of 31 human hippocampal specimens are combined using a groupwise diffeomorphic registration approach into a 3D probabilistic atlas that captures average anatomy and anatomic variability of hippocampal subfields. Serial histological imaging in 9 of the 31 specimens was used to label hippocampal subfields in the atlas based on cytoarchitecture. Specimens were obtained from autopsies in patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD; 9 subjects, 13 hemispheres), of other dementia (nine subjects, nine hemispheres), and in subjects without dementia (seven subjects, nine hemispheres), and morphometric analysis was performed in atlas space to measure effects of age and AD on hippocampal subfields. Disproportional involvement of the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 subfield and stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare was found in AD, with lesser involvement of the dentate gyrus and CA2/3 subfields. An association with age was found for the dentate gyrus and, to a lesser extent, for CA1. Three-dimensional patterns of variability and disease and aging effects discovered via the ex vivo hippocampus atlas provide information highly relevant to the active field of in vivo hippocampal subfield imaging.},

	Abstract = {Filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are encountered in a number of neurodegenerative diseases referred to as 'tauopathies'. In the most prevalent tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, tau pathology progresses in a stereotypical manner with the first lesions appearing in the locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex from where they appear to spread to the hippocampus and neocortex. Propagation of tau pathology is also characteristic of argyrophilic grain disease, where the tau lesions appear to spread throughout distinct regions of the limbic system. These findings strongly implicate neurone-to-neurone propagation of tau aggregates. Isoform composition and morphology of tau filaments can differ between tauopathies suggesting the existence of conformationally diverse tau strains. Altogether, this points to prion-like mechanisms in the pathogenesis of tauopathies. },

	Abstract = {[F-18]-MK-6240, a novel tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracer recently discovered for the in vivo detection of neurofibrillary tangles, has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy in the detection of Alzheimer disease. We have examined regional and substrate-specific binding patterns as well as possible off-target binding of this tracer on human brain tissue to advance towards its validation. We applied [F-18]-MK-6240 phosphor screen and high resolution autoradiography to postmortem samples from patients with a definite pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau (Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration), chronic traumatic encephalopathy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-Tar DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), dementia with Lewy bodies, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and elderly controls free of pathologic changes of neurodegenerative disease. We also directly compared the binding properties of [F-18]-MK-6240 and [F-18]-AV-1451 in human tissue, and examined potential nonspecific binding of both tau tracers to monoamine oxidases (MAO) by using autoradiography in the presence of selective monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors. Our data indicate that MK-6240 strongly binds to neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease but does not seem to bind to a significant extent to tau aggregates in non-Alzheimer tauopathies, suggesting that it may have a limited utility for the in vivo detection of these pathologies. There is no evidence of binding to lesions containing β-amyloid, α-synuclein or TDP-43. In addition, we identified MK-6240 strong off-target binding to neuromelanin and melanin-containing cells, and some weaker binding to areas of hemorrhage. These binding patterns are nearly identical to those previously reported by our group and others for [F-18]-AV-1451. Of note, [F-18]-MK-6240 and [F-18]-AV-1451 autoradiographic binding signals were only weakly displaced by competing concentrations of selective MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl but not by MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline, suggesting that MAO enzymes do not appear to be a significant binding target of any of these two tracers. Together these novel findings provide relevant insights for the correct interpretation of in vivo [F-18]-MK-6240 PET imaging.},

@article{lowe16,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is essential to determine the specificity of AV-1451 PET for tau in brain imaging by using pathological comparisons. We performed autoradiography in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders to evaluate the specificity of AV-1451 binding for tau aggregates.
METHODS: Tissue samples were selected that had a variety of dementia-related neuropathologies including Alzheimer disease, primary age-related tauopathy, tangle predominant dementia, non-Alzheimer disease tauopathies, frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism, Lewy body disease and multiple system atrophy (n = 38). Brain tissue sections were stained for tau, TAR DNA-binding protein-43, and α-synuclein and compared to AV-1451 autoradiography on adjacent sections.
RESULTS: AV-1451 preferentially localized to neurofibrillary tangles, with less binding to areas enriched in neuritic pathology and less mature tau. The strength of AV-1451 binding with respect to tau isoforms in various neurodegenerative disorders was: 3R + 4R tau (e.g., AD) > 3R tau (e.g., Pick disease) or 4R tau. Only minimal binding of AV-1451 to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions was detected. No binding of AV-1451 to α-synuclein was detected. "Off-target" binding was seen in vessels, iron-associated regions, substantia nigra, calcifications in the choroid plexus, and leptomeningeal melanin.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced AV-1451 binding in neuritic pathology compared to neurofibrillary tangles suggests that the maturity of tau pathology may affect AV-1451 binding and suggests complexity in AV-1451 binding. Poor association of AV-1451 with tauopathies that have preferential accumulation of either 4R tau or 3R tau suggests limited clinical utility in detecting these pathologies. In contrast, for disorders associated with 3R + 4R tau, such as Alzheimer disease, AV-1451 binds tau avidly but does not completely reflect the early stage tau progression suggested by Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging. AV-1451 binding to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 or TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions can be weakly positive. Clinical use of AV-1451 will require a familiarity with distinct types of "off-target" binding.},

	Abstract = {Classifying medically imaged objects, e.g., into diseased and normal classes, has been one of the important goals in medical imaging. We propose a novel classification scheme that uses a skeletal representation to provide rich non-Euclidean geometric object properties. Our statistical method combines distance weighted discrimination (DWD) with a carefully chosen Euclideanization which takes full advantage of the geometry of the manifold on which these non-Euclidean geometric object properties (GOPs) live. Our method is evaluated via the task of classifying 3D hippocampi between schizophrenics and healthy controls. We address three central questions. 1) Does adding shape features increase discriminative power over the more standard classification based only on global volume? 2) If so, does our skeletal representation provide greater discriminative power than a conventional boundary point distribution model (PDM)? 3) Especially, is Euclideanization of non-Euclidean shape properties important in achieving high discriminative power? Measuring the capability of a method in terms of area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, we show that our proposed method achieves strongly better classification than both the classification method based on global volume alone and the s-rep-based classification method without proper Euclideanization of non-Euclidean GOPs. We show classification using Euclideanized s-reps is also superior to classification using PDMs, whether the PDMs are first Euclideanized or not. We also show improved performance with Euclideanized boundary PDMs over non-linear boundary PDMs. This demonstrates the benefit that proper Euclideanization of non-Euclidean GOPs brings not only to s-rep-based classification but also to PDM-based classification. },

	Abstract = {Olfactory dysfunction has been reported to occur already in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to increase with disease severity. In neuropathological research, the deposition of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques in the olfactory bulb and tract (OBT) of AD patients has been consistently demonstrated. We used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the volume of the OBT in 21 patients with early AD and in 21 healthy comparison subjects. The OBT was manually traced on consecutive coronal slices. When compared to healthy controls, right, left and mean OBT volumes were significantly reduced in patients with AD (p<0.01). In AD patients, the mean OBT volume was significantly correlated with global cognitive performance as determined by the mini-mental state examination (r=0.605; p=0.004). Manual tracing on MRI images revealed OBT atrophy to be present early in the course of AD. Since the respective findings were associated with cognitive impairment, they may contribute to early recognition and diagnosis of the disease.},

	Abstract = {Extracting anatomical and functional significant structures renders one of the important tasks for both the theoretical study of the medical image analysis, and the clinical and practical community. In the past, much work has been dedicated only to the algorithmic development. Nevertheless, for clinical end users, a well designed algorithm with an interactive software is necessary for an algorithm to be utilized in their daily work. Furthermore, the software would better be open sourced in order to be used and validated by not only the authors but also the entire community. Therefore, the contribution of the present work is twofolds: first, we propose a new robust statistics based conformal metric and the conformal area driven multiple active contour framework, to simultaneously extract multiple targets from MR and CT medical imagery in 3D. Second, an open source graphically interactive 3D segmentation tool based on the aforementioned contour evolution is implemented and is publicly available for end users on multiple platforms. In using this software for the segmentation task, the process is initiated by the user drawn strokes (seeds) in the target region in the image. Then, the local robust statistics are used to describe the object features, and such features are learned adaptively from the seeds under a non-parametric estimation scheme. Subsequently, several active contours evolve simultaneously with their interactions being motivated by the principles of action and reaction-this not only guarantees mutual exclusiveness among the contours, but also no longer relies upon the assumption that the multiple objects fill the entire image domain, which was tacitly or explicitly assumed in many previous works. In doing so, the contours interact and converge to equilibrium at the desired positions of the desired multiple objects. Furthermore, with the aim of not only validating the algorithm and the software, but also demonstrating how the tool is to be used, we provide the reader reproducible experiments that demonstrate the capability of the proposed segmentation tool on several public available data sets.},

	Abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for segmenting brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into anatomical compartments such as the major tissue classes and neuro-anatomical structures of the gray matter. The algorithm is guided by prior information represented within a tree structure. The tree mirrors the hierarchy of anatomical structures and the subtrees correspond to limited segmentation problems. The solution to each problem is estimated via a conventional classifier. Our algorithm can be adapted to a wide range of segmentation problems by modifying the tree structure or replacing the classifier. We evaluate the performance of our new segmentation approach by revisiting a previously published statistical group comparison between first-episode schizophrenia patients, first-episode affective psychosis patients, and comparison subjects. The original study is based on 50 MR volumes in which an expert identified the brain tissue classes as well as the superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus. We generate analogous segmentations using our new method and repeat the statistical group comparison. The results of our analysis are similar to the original findings, except for one structure (the left superior temporal gyrus) in which a trend-level statistical significance (p = 0.07) was observed instead of statistical significance.},

Deep learning is rapidly becoming the state of the art, leading to enhanced performance in various medical applications. We introduce the fundamentals of deep learning methods and review their successes in image registration, detection of anatomical and cellular structures, tissue segmentation, computer-aided disease diagnosis and prognosis, and so on.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a trial comparing coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone with CABG plus mitral-valve repair in patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation, we found no significant difference in the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) or survival after 1 year. Concomitant mitral-valve repair was associated with a reduced prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, but patients had more adverse events. We now report 2-year outcomes.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 301 patients to undergo either CABG alone or the combined procedure. Patients were followed for 2 years for clinical and echocardiographic outcomes.
RESULTS: At 2 years, the mean ($\pm$SD) LVESVI was 41.2$\pm$20.0 ml per square meter of body-surface area in the CABG-alone group and 43.2$\pm$20.6 ml per square meter in the combined-procedure group (mean improvement over baseline, -14.1 ml per square meter and -14.6 ml per square meter, respectively). The rate of death was 10.6% in the CABG-alone group and 10.0% in the combined-procedure group (hazard ratio in the combined-procedure group, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.83; P=0.78). There was no significant between-group difference in the rank-based assessment of the LVESVI (including death) at 2 years (z score, 0.38; P=0.71). The 2-year rate of moderate or severe residual mitral regurgitation was higher in the CABG-alone group than in the combined-procedure group (32.3% vs. 11.2%, P<0.001). Overall rates of hospital readmission and serious adverse events were similar in the two groups, but neurologic events and supraventricular arrhythmias remained more frequent in the combined-procedure group.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation undergoing CABG, the addition of mitral-valve repair did not lead to significant differences in left ventricular reverse remodeling at 2 years. Mitral-valve repair provided a more durable correction of mitral regurgitation but did not significantly improve survival or reduce overall adverse events or readmissions and was associated with an early hazard of increased neurologic events and supraventricular arrhythmias.

@article{jassar14,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The saddle shape of the normal mitral annulus has been quantitatively described by several groups. There is strong evidence that this shape is important to valve function. A more complete understanding of regional annular geometry in diseased valves may provide a more educated approach to annuloplasty ring selection and design. We hypothesized that mitral annular shape is markedly distorted in patients with diseased valves.
METHODS: Real-time 3-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 20 patients with normal mitral valves, 10 with ischemic mitral regurgitation, and 20 with myxomatous mitral regurgitation (MMR). Thirty-six annular points were defined to generate a 3-dimensional model of the annulus. Regional annular parameters were measured from these renderings. Left ventricular inner diameter was obtained from 2-dimensional echocardiographic images.
RESULTS: Annular geometry was significantly different among the three groups. The annuli were larger in the MMR and in the ischemic mitral regurgitation groups. The annular enlargement was greater and more pervasive in the MMR group. Both diseases were associated with annular flattening, although though the regional distribution of that flattening was different between groups. Left ventricular inner diameter was increased in both groups. However, relative to the Left ventricular inner diameter, the annulus was disproportionately dilated in the MMR group.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MMR and ischemic mitral regurgitation have enlarged and flattened annuli. In the case of MMR, annular distortions may be the driving factor leading to valve incompetence. These data suggest that the goal of annuloplasty should be the restoration of normal annular saddle shape and that the use of flexible, partial, and flat rings may be ill advised.},

@article{vergnat12,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Reports indicate that repair procedures for ischaemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) are less durable than previously thought. Repair failure has been shown to be stress related. Leaflet curvature is the major determinant of valve stress. Theoretical and animal experiments have shown that saddle-shaped annuloplasty optimizes leaflet curvature when compared with standard flat ring annuloplasty. Despite this, the influence of the ring shape on leaflet curvature has not been described in patients with IMR. This study uses real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (rt-3DE) to assess the influence of the ring shape on leaflet curvature.
METHODS: Rt-3DE was performed in 21 patients with IMR after placement of either a flat (n = 10, CE-Physio, Edwards) or saddle-shaped (n = 11, Profile 3D, Medtronic) annuloplasty ring. A combination of commercially available and customized software was used to measure multiple leaflet curvature parameters across all regions of the mitral valve.
RESULTS: Independently of the shape of the annuloplasty ring, all patients were subject to the same degree of annular undersizing. Patients who received saddle-shaped annuloplasty rings had greater leaflet curvature in all six mitral valve leaflet regions (A1 = 0.36 $\pm$ 0.10, A2 = 0.53 $\pm$ 0.13, A3 = 0.47 $\pm$ 0.13, P1 = 0.35 $\pm$ 0.23, P2 = 0.53 $\pm$ 0.34, P3 = 0.42 $\pm$ 0.20 cm(-2)) compared with patients who received flat annuloplasty rings (A1 = 0.16 $\pm$ 0.11, A2 = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.09, A3 = 0.16 $\pm$ 0.11, P1 = 0.20 $\pm$ 0.17, P2 = 0.21 $\pm$ 0.11, P3 = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.13 cm(-2)). These differences were statistically significant in all regions except the P1 region.
CONCLUSIONS: Saddle-shaped annuloplasty rings increase leaflet curvature compared with flat rings in patients with IMR. As a result, saddle-shaped annuloplasty may decrease leaflet stress and potentially increases the durability of the repair in patients with IMR.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the neuropathological substrates underlying in vivo hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in autopsy confirmed neurodegenerative dementia cases.
METHODS: Thirty-one neuropathologically verified cases (23 with Lewy body dementia (LBD) and eight with Alzheimer's disease (AD)) were included who had undergone an MRI scan close to death (mean 1.5 years). Manual volumetric measurements were undertaken for the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala on MRI, along with quantitative neuropathological analysis of plaque, tangle and Lewy body pathology in the same regions. The relationship between neuropathology and MRI volumes was assessed using correlations and linear regression.
RESULTS: Hippocampal and amygdala volumes were significantly smaller in cases with AD than with LBD, but there was no difference in entorhinal cortex volume. Analysing all cases together, a significant positive correlation was observed between normalised hippocampal volume and percent area of Lewy bodies in the hippocampus (r=0.449, p=0.017) but not with tangles (r=0.059, p=0.766) or plaques (r=-0.361, p=0.119). There were no other significant correlations between regional MRI volume and measures of neuropathology. Regression analysis showed that overall diagnosis of AD rather than burden of individual pathological changes was the most significant predictor of hippocampal volume loss in autopsy confirmed cases.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that (i) hippocampal and amygdala but not entorhinal cortex, volumes differ between AD and LBD and (ii) factors other than current markers of neurodegenerative pathological change are responsible for atrophy of medial temporal lobe structures in AD and LBD.},

	Abstract = {One of the main purposes in computational anatomy is the measurement and statistical study of anatomical variations in organs, notably in the brain or the heart. Over the last decade, our group has progressively developed several approaches for this problem, all related to the Riemannian geometry of groups of diffeomorphisms and the shape spaces on which these groups act. Several important shape evolution equations that are now used routinely in applications have emerged over time. Our goal in this paper is to provide an overview of these equations, placing them in their theoretical context, and giving examples of applications in which they can be used. We introduce the required theoretical background before discussing several classes of equations of increasingly complexity. These equations include energy minimizing evolutions deriving from Riemannian gradient descent, geodesics, parallel transport and Jacobi fields. },

	Abstract = {High-field, pre-clinical MRI systems are widely used to characterise tissue structure and volume in small animals, using high resolution imaging. Both applications rely heavily on the consistent, accurate calibration of imaging gradients, yet such calibrations are typically only performed during maintenance sessions by equipment manufacturers, and potentially with acceptance limits that are inadequate for phenotyping. To overcome this difficulty, we present a protocol for gradient calibration quality assurance testing, based on a 3D-printed, open source, structural phantom that can be customised to the dimensions of individual scanners and RF coils. In trials on a 9.4 T system, the gradient scaling errors were reduced by an order of magnitude, and displacements of greater than 100 µm, caused by gradient non-linearity, were corrected using a post-processing technique. The step-by-step protocol can be integrated into routine pre-clinical MRI quality assurance to measure and correct for these errors. We suggest that this type of quality assurance is essential for robust pre-clinical MRI experiments that rely on accurate imaging gradients, including small animal phenotyping and diffusion MR.},

The review focuses on approaches that can be applied using the SPM software package, beginning by explaining briefly how statistical parametric mapping is usually applied to functional imaging data. The review then proceeds to discuss volumetry, with an emphasis on voxel-based morphometry, and the pre-processing steps involved using the SPM software. Most volumetric studies involve univariate approaches, with a correction for some global measure, such as total brain volume. In contrast, the overall form of the brain may be more accurately modeled using multivariate approaches. Such models of anatomical variability may prove accurate enough for computer assisted diagnoses.},

Specifically, we will describe our applied mathematical approaches to the segmentation of cortical and subcortical structure, the analysis of white matter fiber tracks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and the intersubject registration of neuroanatomical (aMRI) data sets. Many of our methods rally around the use of geometric constraints, statistical (MAP) estimation, and the use of level set evolution strategies. The analysis of gray matter structure and connecting white matter paths combined with the ability to bring all information into a common space via intersubject registration should provide us with a rich set of data to investigate structure and variation in the human brain in neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as provide a basis for current work in the development of integrated brain function-structure analysis.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative analysis has tremendous but mostly unrealized potential in healthcare to support objective and accurate interpretation of the clinical imaging. In 2008, the National Cancer Institute began building the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) initiative with the goal of advancing quantitative imaging in the context of personalized therapy and evaluation of treatment response. Computerized analysis is an important component contributing to reproducibility and efficiency of the quantitative imaging techniques. The success of quantitative imaging is contingent on robust analysis methods and software tools to bring these methods from bench to bedside. 3D Slicer is a free open-source software application for medical image computing. As a clinical research tool, 3D Slicer is similar to a radiology workstation that supports versatile visualizations but also provides advanced functionality such as automated segmentation and registration for a variety of application domains. Unlike a typical radiology workstation, 3D Slicer is free and is not tied to specific hardware. As a programming platform, 3D Slicer facilitates translation and evaluation of the new quantitative methods by allowing the biomedical researcher to focus on the implementation of the algorithm and providing abstractions for the common tasks of data communication, visualization and user interface development. Compared to other tools that provide aspects of this functionality, 3D Slicer is fully open source and can be readily extended and redistributed. In addition, 3D Slicer is designed to facilitate the development of new functionality in the form of 3D Slicer extensions. In this paper, we present an overview of 3D Slicer as a platform for prototyping, development and evaluation of image analysis tools for clinical research applications. To illustrate the utility of the platform in the scope of QIN, we discuss several use cases of 3D Slicer by the existing QIN teams, and we elaborate on the future directions that can further facilitate development and validation of imaging biomarkers using 3D Slicer.},

The utility of existing image-processing software is often limited by cost, lack of flexibility, and/or specific hardware requirements. In particular, many existing packages cannot directly utilize images formatted using the specifications in part 10 of the DICOM standard ("DICOM images"). We show how image analyses can be performed directly on DICOM images by using ImageJ, a free, Java-based image-processing package (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). We demonstrate how plug-ins written in our laboratory can be used along with the ImageJ macro script language to create flexible, low-cost, multiplatform image-processing applications that can be directed by information contained in the DICOM image header.},

	Abstract = {Volumetric segmentation of the placenta using 3-D ultrasound is currently performed clinically to investigate correlation between organ volume and fetal outcome or pathology. Previously, interpolative or semi-automatic contour-based methodologies were used to provide volumetric results. We describe the validation of an original random walker (RW)-based algorithm against manual segmentation and an existing semi-automated method, virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL), using initialization time, inter- and intra-observer variability of volumetric measurements and quantification accuracy (with respect to manual segmentation) as metrics of success. Both semi-automatic methods require initialization. Therefore, the first experiment compared initialization times. Initialization was timed by one observer using 20 subjects. This revealed significant differences (p < 0.001) in time taken to initialize the VOCAL method compared with the RW method. In the second experiment, 10 subjects were used to analyze intra-/inter-observer variability between two observers. Bland-Altman plots were used to analyze variability combined with intra- and inter-observer variability measured by intra-class correlation coefficients, which were reported for all three methods. Intra-class correlation coefficient values for intra-observer variability were higher for the RW method than for VOCAL, and both were similar to manual segmentation. Inter-observer variability was 0.94 (0.88, 0.97), 0.91 (0.81, 0.95) and 0.80 (0.61, 0.90) for manual, RW and VOCAL, respectively. Finally, a third observer with no prior ultrasound experience was introduced and volumetric differences from manual segmentation were reported. Dice similarity coefficients for observers 1, 2 and 3 were respectively 0.84 $\pm$ 0.12, 0.94 $\pm$ 0.08 and 0.84 $\pm$ 0.11, and the mean was 0.87 $\pm$ 0.13. The RW algorithm was found to provide results concordant with those for manual segmentation and to outperform VOCAL in aspects of observer reliability. The training of an additional untrained observer was investigated, and results revealed that with the appropriate initialization protocol, results for observers with varying levels of experience were concordant. We found that with appropriate training, the RW method can be used for fast, repeatable 3-D measurement of placental volume.},

	Abstract = {Fetal growth restriction is one of the greatest risk factors for stillbirth. This pilot cohort study examined whether rapid placental volume (PlaV) calculation at 11 to 13 + 6 weeks can predict the small for gestational age (cSGA) baby. Women with singleton pregnancies were recruited (N = 145), a static three-dimensional (3-D) volume was captured, and the placental volume was computed using a semi-automated technique. Regression analysis explored the relationships between customized birth weight, placental quotient (PQ), standardized placental volume (sPlaV), and other predictors of SGA (including pregnancy-associated protein and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI). The results were examined using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the total population and then in the 2 subgroups whose members were classified as low risk or high risk at booking. Both PQ and sPlaV were significantly different for cSGA pregnancies compared to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) babies (p = 0.003 and <0.001, respectively) but only sPlaV was normally distributed. The independent predictors of birth weight (sPlaV, pregnancy associated protein, and nuchal translucency) were combined to produce a predictive model for cSGA. The ROC curves for prediction of cSGA in all 143 women gave areas under the curve of 0.77 (0.66 to 0.87) for sPlaV alone and 0.80 (0.69 to 0.92) for the combined model. When this was applied to the low-risk group, the areas under the curve were 0.82 (0.69 to 0.94) and 0.84 (0.72 to 0.95), respectively. For the high-risk group, the areas under the curve were 0.67 (0.45 to 0.86) for sPlaV alone and 0.76 (0.55 to 0.96) for the combined model. The use of this rapid-image analysis technique and dimensionless index to correct for gestation brings the possibility of an early combined screening test for the cSGA baby a step closer.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal volumetry derived from structural MRI is increasingly used to delineate regions of interest for functional measurements, assess efficacy in therapeutic trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and has been endorsed by the new AD diagnostic guidelines as a radiological marker of disease progression. Unfortunately, morphological heterogeneity in AD can prevent accurate demarcation of the hippocampus. Recent developments in automated volumetry commonly use multi-template fusion driven by expert manual labels, enabling highly accurate and reproducible segmentation in disease and healthy subjects. However, there are several protocols to define the hippocampus anatomically in vivo, and the method used to generate atlases may impact automatic accuracy and sensitivity - particularly in pathologically heterogeneous samples. Here we report a fully automated segmentation technique that provides a robust platform to directly evaluate both technical and biomarker performance in AD among anatomically unique labeling protocols. For the first time we test head-to-head the performance of five common hippocampal labeling protocols for multi-atlas based segmentation, using both the Sunnybrook Longitudinal Dementia Study and the entire Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) baseline and 24-month dataset. We based these atlas libraries on the protocols of (Haller et al., 1997; Killiany et al., 1993; Malykhin et al., 2007; Pantel et al., 2000; Pruessner et al., 2000), and a single operator performed all manual tracings to generate de facto "ground truth" labels. All methods distinguished between normal elders, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD in the expected directions, and showed comparable correlations with measures of episodic memory performance. Only more inclusive protocols distinguished between stable MCI and MCI-to-AD converters, and had slightly better associations with episodic memory. Moreover, we demonstrate that protocols including more posterior anatomy and dorsal white matter compartments furnish the best voxel-overlap accuracies (Dice Similarity Coefficient=0.87-0.89), compared to expert manual tracings, and achieve the smallest sample sizes required to power clinical trials in MCI and AD. The greatest distribution of errors was localized to the caudal hippocampus and the alveus-fimbria compartment when these regions were excluded. The definition of the medial body did not significantly alter accuracy among more comprehensive protocols. Voxel-overlap accuracies between automatic and manual labels were lower for the more pathologically heterogeneous Sunnybrook study in comparison to the ADNI-1 sample. Finally, accuracy among protocols appears to significantly differ the most in AD subjects compared to MCI and normal elders. Together, these results suggest that selection of a candidate protocol for fully automatic multi-template based segmentation in AD can influence both segmentation accuracy when compared to expert manual labels and performance as a biomarker in MCI and AD.},

	Abstract = {GOAL: In this paper, a fully automatic probabilistic method for multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion classification is presented, whereby the posterior probability density function over healthy tissues and two types of lesions (T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense) is generated at every voxel.
METHODS: During training, the system explicitly models the spatial variability of the intensity distributions throughout the brain by first segmenting it into distinct anatomical regions and then building regional likelihood distributions for each tissue class based on multimodal magnetic resonance image (MRI) intensities. Local class smoothness is ensured by incorporating neighboring voxel information in the prior probability through Markov random fields. The system is tested on two datasets from real multisite clinical trials consisting of multimodal MRIs from a total of 100 patients with MS. Lesion classification results based on the framework are compared with and without the regional information, as well as with other state-of-the-art methods against the labels from expert manual raters. The metrics for comparison include Dice overlap, sensitivity, and positive predictive rates for both voxel and lesion classifications.
RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements in Dice values ( ), for voxel-based and lesion-based sensitivity values ( ), and positive predictive rates ( and respectively) are shown when the proposed method is compared to the method without regional information, and to a widely used method [1]. This holds particularly true in the posterior fossa, an area where classification is very challenging.
SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method allows us to provide clinicians with accurate tissue labels for T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense lesions, two types of lesions that differ in appearance and clinical ramifications, and with a confidence level in the classification, which helps clinicians assess the classification results.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on the detection and segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance (MRI) brain images. To capture the complex tissue spatial layout, a probabilistic model termed Constrained Gaussian Mixture Model (CGMM) is proposed based on a mixture of multiple spatially oriented Gaussians per tissue. The intensity of a tissue is considered a global parameter and is constrained, by a parameter-tying scheme, to be the same value for the entire set of Gaussians that are related to the same tissue. MS lesions are identified as outlier Gaussian components and are grouped to form a new class in addition to the healthy tissue classes. A probability-based curve evolution technique is used to refine the delineation of lesion boundaries. The proposed CGMM-CE algorithm is used to segment 3D MRI brain images with an arbitrary number of channels. The CGMM-CE algorithm is automated and does not require an atlas for initialization or parameter learning. Experimental results on both standard brain MRI simulation data and real data indicate that the proposed method outperforms previously suggested approaches, especially for highly noisy data.},

@article{schmidt12,
	Abstract = {In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), detection of T2-hyperintense white matter (WM) lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a crucial criterion for diagnosis and predicting prognosis in early disease. Automated lesion detection is not only desirable with regard to time and cost effectiveness but also constitutes a prerequisite to minimize user bias. Here, we developed and evaluated an algorithm for automated lesion detection requiring a three-dimensional (3D) gradient echo (GRE) T1-weighted and a FLAIR image at 3 Tesla (T). Our tool determines the three tissue classes of gray matter (GM) and WM as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the T1-weighted image, and, then, the FLAIR intensity distribution of each tissue class in order to detect outliers, which are interpreted as lesion beliefs. Next, a conservative lesion belief is expanded toward a liberal lesion belief. To this end, neighboring voxels are analyzed and assigned to lesions under certain conditions. This is done iteratively until no further voxels are assigned to lesions. Herein, the likelihood of belonging to WM or GM is weighed against the likelihood of belonging to lesions. We evaluated our algorithm in 53 MS patients with different lesion volumes, in 10 patients with posterior fossa lesions, and 18 control subjects that were all scanned at the same 3T scanner (Achieva, Philips, Netherlands). We found good agreement with lesions determined by manual tracing (R2 values of over 0.93 independent of FLAIR slice thickness up to 6mm). These results require validation with data from other protocols based on a conventional FLAIR sequence and a 3D GRE T1-weighted sequence. Yet, we believe that our tool allows fast and reliable segmentation of FLAIR-hyperintense lesions, which might simplify the quantification of lesions in basic research and even clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation is crucial for evaluating disease burden, determining disease progression and measuring the impact of new clinical treatments. MS lesions can vary in size, location and intensity, making automatic segmentation challenging. In this paper, we propose a new supervised method to segment MS lesions from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images using non-local means (NLM). The method uses a multi-channel and rotation-invariant distance measure to account for the diversity of MS lesions. The proposed segmentation method, rotation-invariant multi-contrast non-local means segmentation (RMNMS), captures the MS lesion spatial distribution and can accurately and robustly identify lesions regardless of their orientation, shape or size. An internal validation on a large clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of MS patients demonstrated a good similarity measure result (Dice similarity = 60.1% and sensitivity = 75.4%), a strong correlation between expert and automatic lesion load volumes (R(2) = 0.91), and a strong ability to detect lesions of different sizes and in varying spatial locations (lesion detection rate = 79.8%). On the independent MS Grand Challenge (MSGC) dataset validation, our method provided competitive results with state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Qualitative visual and quantitative voxel- and lesion-wise evaluations demonstrated the accuracy of RMNMS method.},

	Abstract = {Purpose To investigate relationships between computer-extracted breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging phenotypes with multigene assays of MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, and PAM50 to assess the role of radiomics in evaluating the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Materials and Methods Analysis was conducted on an institutional review board-approved retrospective data set of 84 deidentified, multi-institutional breast MR examinations from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Imaging Archive, along with clinical, histopathologic, and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The data set of biopsy-proven invasive breast cancers included 74 (88%) ductal, eight (10%) lobular, and two (2%) mixed cancers. Of these, 73 (87%) were estrogen receptor positive, 67 (80%) were progesterone receptor positive, and 19 (23%) were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive. For each case, computerized radiomics of the MR images yielded computer-extracted tumor phenotypes of size, shape, margin morphology, enhancement texture, and kinetic assessment. Regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were conducted to assess the predictive ability of the MR radiomics features relative to the multigene assay classifications. Results Multiple linear regression analyses demonstrated significant associations (R(2) = 0.25-0.32, r = 0.5-0.56, P < .0001) between radiomics signatures and multigene assay recurrence scores. Important radiomics features included tumor size and enhancement texture, which indicated tumor heterogeneity. Use of radiomics in the task of distinguishing between good and poor prognosis yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.88 (standard error, 0.05), 0.76 (standard error, 0.06), 0.68 (standard error, 0.08), and 0.55 (standard error, 0.09) for MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, PAM50 risk of relapse based on subtype, and PAM50 risk of relapse based on subtype and proliferation, respectively, with all but the latter showing statistical difference from chance. Conclusion Quantitative breast MR imaging radiomics shows promise for image-based phenotyping in assessing the risk of breast cancer recurrence.

	Abstract = {We present a methodological framework for multichannel Markov random fields (MRFs). We show that conditional independence allows loopy belief propagation to solve a multichannel MRF as a single channel MRF. We use conditional mutual information to search for features that satisfy conditional independence assumptions. Using this framework we incorporate kinetic feature maps derived from breast dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging as observation channels in MRF for tumor segmentation. Our algorithm based on multichannel MRF achieves an receiver operating characteristic area under curve (AUC) of 0.97 for tumor segmentation when using a radiologist's manual delineation as ground truth. Single channel MRF based on the best feature chosen from the same pool of features as used by the multichannel MRF achieved a lower AUC of 0.89. We also present a comparison against the well established normalized cuts segmentation algorithm along with commonly used approaches for breast tumor segmentation including fuzzy C-means (FCM) and the more recent method of running FCM on enhancement variance features (FCM-VES). These previous methods give a lower AUC of 0.92, 0.88, and 0.60, respectively. Finally, we also investigate the role of superior segmentation in feature extraction and tumor characterization. Specifically, we examine the effect of improved segmentation on predicting the probability of breast cancer recurrence as determined by a validated tumor gene expression assay. We demonstrate that an support vector machine classifier trained on kinetic statistics extracted from tumors as segmented by our algorithm gives a significant improvement in distinguishing between women with high and low recurrence risk, giving an AUC of 0.88 as compared to 0.79, 0.76, 0.75, and 0.66 when using normalized cuts, single channel MRF, FCM, and FCM-VES, respectively, for segmentation.},

METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed 305 patients with invasive breast cancer at our institution who had ODX RS available. We selected five equations that provide a surrogate measure of ODX as previously published by Klein et al. (Magee equations 1-3), Gage et al., and Tang et al. All equations used estrogen receptor status and progesterone receptor status along with different combinations of grade, proliferation indices (Ki-67, mitotic rate), HER2 status, and tumor size.
RESULTS: Of all surrogate scores tested, the Magee equation 2 provided the highest correlation with ODX both with regard to raw score (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.66 95% CI 0.59-0.72) and categorical correlation (Cohen's kappa = 0.43, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). Although Magee equation 2 provided a way to reliably identify high-risk disease by assigning 95% of the patients with high ODX RS to either the intermediate- or high-risk group, it was unable to reliably identify the potential for patients to have intermediate- or high-risk disease by ODX (66% of such patients identified).
CONCLUSIONS: Although commonly available surrogates for ODX appear to predict high-risk ODX RS, they are unable to reliably rule out the presence of patients with intermediate-risk disease by ODX. Given the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in women with intermediate-risk disease by ODX, current surrogates are unable to safely substitute for ODX. Characterizing the true recurrence risk in patients with intermediate-risk disease by ODX is critical to the clinical adoption of current surrogate markers and is an area of ongoing clinical trials.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the frequency of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U) in the setting of hippocampal sclerosis (HpScl) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) using immunohistochemistry for TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a putative marker for FTLD-U.
METHODS: Initially, 21 cases of HpScl associated with a variety of other pathological processes and 74 cases of AD were screened for FTLD-U with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry. A confirmation study was performed on 93 additional AD cases. Specificity of TDP-43 antibodies was assessed using double-immunolabeling confocal microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and biochemistry.
RESULTS: TDP-43 immunoreactivity was detected in 71% of HpScl and 23% of AD cases. Double immunostaining of AD cases for TDP-43 and phospho-tau showed that the TDP-43-immunoreactive inclusions were usually distinct from neurofibrillary tangles. At the ultrastructural level, TDP-43 immunoreactivity in AD was associated with granular and filamentous cytosolic material and only occasionally associated with tau filaments. Western blots of AD cases showed a band that migrated at a higher molecular weight than normal TDP-43 that was not present in AD cases without TDP-43 immunoreactivity.
INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that as many as 20% of AD cases and more than 70% of HpScl cases have pathology similar to that found in FTLD-U. Whether this represents concomitant FTLD-U or is analogous to colocalization of alpha-synuclein and tau in AD, reflecting a propensity for codeposition of abnormal protein conformers, remains to be determined.},

	Abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by selective and progressive loss of specific populations of neurons, which determines the clinical presentation. The same neuronal populations can be affected in a number of different disorders. Given that the clinical presentation reflects the particular population of neurons that are targets of the disease process, it is clear that for any given clinical syndrome, more than one neurodegenerative disease can account for the clinical syndrome. Because of this clinical ambiguity, for the purpose of this brief review neurodegenerative disorders are classified according to the underlying molecular pathology rather than their clinical presentation. The major neurodegenerative diseases can be classified into amyloidoses, tauopathies, alpha-synucleinopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine region- and substrate-specific autoradiographic and in vitro binding patterns of positron emission tomography tracer [F-18]-AV-1451 (previously known as T807), tailored to allow in vivo detection of paired helical filament-tau-containing lesions, and to determine whether there is off-target binding to other amyloid/non-amyloid proteins.
METHODS: We applied [F-18]-AV-1451 phosphor screen autoradiography, [F-18]-AV-1451 nuclear emulsion autoradiography, and [H-3]-AV-1451 in vitro binding assays to the study of postmortem samples from patients with a definite pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and elderly controls free of pathology.
RESULTS: Our data suggest that [F-18]-AV-1451 strongly binds to tau lesions primarily made of paired helical filaments in Alzheimer brains (eg, intraneuronal and extraneuronal tangles and dystrophic neurites), but does not seem to bind to a significant extent to neuronal and glial inclusions mainly composed of straight tau filaments in non-Alzheimer tauopathy brains or to lesions containing β-amyloid, α-synuclein, or TDP-43. [F-18]-AV-1451 off-target binding to neuromelanin- and melanin-containing cells and, to a lesser extent, to brain hemorrhagic lesions was identified.
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest that [F-18]-AV-1451 holds promise as a surrogate marker for the detection of brain tau pathology in the form of tangles and paired helical filament-tau-containing neurites in Alzheimer brains but also point to its relatively lower affinity for lesions primarily made of straight tau filaments in non-Alzheimer tauopathy cases and to the existence of some [F-18]-AV-1451 off-target binding. These findings provide important insights for interpreting in vivo patterns of [F-18]-AV-1451 retention.},

METHODS: Clinical Core activities and plans were synthesized based on discussions among the Core leaders and external advisors.
RESULTS: The longitudinal data in ADNI-2 provide natural history data on a clinical trials population and continue to inform refinement and standardization of assessments, models of trajectories, and clinical trial methods that have been extended into sporadic preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD).
DISCUSSION: Plans for the next phase of the ADNI project include maintaining longitudinal follow-up of the normal and mild cognitive impairment cohorts, augmenting specific clinical cohorts, and incorporating novel computerized cognitive assessments and patient-reported outcomes. A major hypothesis is that AD represents a gradually progressive disease that can be identified precisely in its long presymptomatic phase, during which intervention with potentially disease-modifying agents may be most useful.},

	Abstract = {Many image enhancement and thresholding techniques make use of spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal. The most common such approach in neuroimaging is cluster-based thresholding, which is often more sensitive than voxel-wise thresholding. However, a limitation is the need to define the initial cluster-forming threshold. This threshold is arbitrary, and yet its exact choice can have a large impact on the results, particularly at the lower (e.g., t, z < 4) cluster-forming thresholds frequently used. Furthermore, the amount of spatial pre-smoothing is also arbitrary (given that the expected signal extent is very rarely known in advance of the analysis). In the light of such problems, we propose a new method which attempts to keep the sensitivity benefits of cluster-based thresholding (and indeed the general concept of "clusters" of signal), while avoiding (or at least minimising) these problems. The method takes a raw statistic image and produces an output image in which the voxel-wise values represent the amount of cluster-like local spatial support. The method is thus referred to as "threshold-free cluster enhancement" (TFCE). We present the TFCE approach and discuss in detail ROC-based optimisation and comparisons with cluster-based and voxel-based thresholding. We find that TFCE gives generally better sensitivity than other methods over a wide range of test signal shapes and SNR values. We also show an example on a real imaging dataset, suggesting that TFCE does indeed provide not just improved sensitivity, but richer and more interpretable output than cluster-based thresholding.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pathologic changes in the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain occur in a hierarchical neuroanatomical pattern affecting cortical, subcortical, and limbic regions.
OBJECTIVE: To define the time course of pathologic and biochemical changes-amyloid deposition, amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation, synaptic loss, and gliosis-within the temporal association cortex of AD cases of varying disease duration, relative to control brains.
METHODS: Stereologic assessments of amyloid burden and tangle density as well as ELISA-based measurements of Abeta, synaptophysin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were performed in the superior temporal sulcus from a cohort of 83 AD and 26 nondemented control brains.
RESULTS: Relative to control cases, AD brains were characterized by accumulation of NFT and amyloid plaques, increase of tris- and formic acid-extractable Abeta species, reduced levels of synaptophysin, and elevated levels of GFAP. In AD cases, the duration of dementia correlated with the degree of tangle formation, gliosis, and synaptic loss but not with any Abeta measures. Accumulation of Abeta, measured both neuropathologically and biochemically, was markedly increased in AD brains independent of disease duration, even in cases of short duration.
CONCLUSIONS: These data support distinct processes in the initiation and progression of AD pathology within the temporal cortex: Deposition of Abeta reaches a "ceiling" early in the disease process, whereas NFT formation, synaptic loss, and gliosis continue throughout the course of the illness.},

Despite their inherently cross-sectional nature, postmortem studies have enabled the staging of the progression of both amyloid and tangle pathologies, and, consequently, the development of diagnostic criteria that are now used worldwide. In addition, clinicopathological correlation studies have been crucial to generate hypotheses about the pathophysiology of the disease, by establishing that there is a continuum between "normal" aging and AD dementia, and that the amyloid plaque build-up occurs primarily before the onset of cognitive deficits, while neurofibrillary tangles, neuron loss, and particularly synaptic loss, parallel the progression of cognitive decline. Importantly, these cross-sectional neuropathological data have been largely validated by longitudinal in vivo studies using modern imaging biomarkers such as amyloid PET and volumetric MRI.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine whether nondemented subjects with pathological evidence of preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) demonstrate neuronal loss in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, and whether the onset of cognitive deficits in AD coincides with the onset of neuronal degeneration.
METHODS: Preclinical AD cases have been defined by the absence of cognitive decline but with neuropathological evidence of AD. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were examined in 13 nondemented cases (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] 0) with healthy brains, 4 cases with preclinical AD, 8 cases with very mild symptomatic AD (CDR 0.5), and 4 cases with severe AD (CDR 3, hippocampus only). The volume and number of neurons were determined stereologically in 2 areas that are vulnerable to AD--the entorhinal cortex (as a whole and layer II alone) and hippocampal field CA1.
RESULTS: There was no significant decrease in neuron number or volume with age in the healthy nondemented group and little or none between the healthy and preclinical AD groups. Substantial decreases were found in the very mild AD group in neuron number (35% in the entorhinal cortex, 50% in layer II, and 46% in CA1) and volume (28% in the entorhinal cortex, 21% in layer II, and 29% in CA1). Greater decrements were observed in CA1 in the severe AD group.
CONCLUSIONS: There is little or no neuronal loss in aging or preclinical AD but substantial loss in very mild AD. The findings indicate that AD results in clinical deficits only when it produces significant neuronal loss.},

	Abstract = {To assess the relationship between dementia, neuronal loss, and neuropathological findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we counted the number of neurons, senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in a high-order association cortex. We studied the superior temporal sulcus of 34 individuals with AD and 17 nondemented control subjects, using statistically unbiased, stereological counting techniques. The number of superior temporal sulcus neurons in nondemented control subjects was stable across the sixth to ninth decades. In AD, more than 50% of the neurons were lost. Both neuronal loss and neurofibrillary tangles increased in parallel with the duration and severity of illness, but the amount of neuronal loss exceeded by manyfold the amount of neurofibrillary tangles accumulated. In contrast to the correlation between neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss, the number of senile plaques and the percentage of the superior temporal sulcus that was covered by Abeta (amyloid burden) were not related to neuronal loss, number of neurofibrillary tangles, or duration of disease. Neither the amount nor the rate of neuronal loss in the superior temporal sulcus in AD correlated with apolipoprotein E genotype. These data suggest that neuronal loss in association areas such as the superior temporal sulcus contributes directly to cognitive impairment in AD.},

	Abstract = {We detected and mapped a dynamically spreading wave of gray matter loss in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The loss pattern was visualized in four dimensions as it spread over time from temporal and limbic cortices into frontal and occipital brain regions, sparing sensorimotor cortices. The shifting deficits were asymmetric (left hemisphere > right hemisphere) and correlated with progressively declining cognitive status (p < 0.0006). Novel brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of atrophy in 52 high-resolution magnetic resonance image scans of 12 patients with AD (age 68.4 +/- 1.9 years) and 14 elderly matched controls (age 71.4 +/- 0.9 years) scanned longitudinally (two scans; interscan interval 2.1 +/- 0.4 years). A cortical pattern matching technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later (>15% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of AD and differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates (5.3 +/- 2.3% per year in AD v 0.9 +/- 0.9% per year in controls) were faster in the left hemisphere (p < 0.029) than the right. Transient barriers to disease progression appeared at limbic/frontal boundaries. This degenerative sequence, observed in vivo as it developed, provides the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.},

	Abstract = {The cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus (CA1) sector of hippocampus is vulnerable to both Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type neurofibrillary degeneration and anoxia-ischemia. The objective of this article is to compare number and size of neurons in CA1 in AD versus ischemic vascular dementia. Unbiased stereological methods were used to estimate the number and volume of neurons in 28 autopsy-derived brain samples. For each case, the entire hippocampus from one cerebral hemisphere was sliced into 5mm slabs (5-7 slabs/case), cut into 50 microm sections, and stained with gallocyanine. Using the optical dissector, we systematically sampled the number and size of neurons throughout the extent of CA1 and CA2. The total number of neurons was significantly less in AD compared with ischemic vascular dementia (p < 0.02), but there was no significant difference in neuron size. The greatest loss of neurons was observed in two cases with combined AD and hippocampal sclerosis. Regardless of causative diagnosis, the number of CA1 neurons correlates with magnetic resonance imaging-derived hippocampal volume (r = 0.72; p < 0.001) and memory score (r = 0.62; p < 0.01). We conclude that although CA1 neuron loss is more consistently observed in AD than ischemic vascular dementia, severity of loss shows the expected correlation with structure and function across causative subtype. Reductions in magnetic resonance imaging-derived hippocampal volume reflect loss, rather than shrinkage, of CA1 neurons.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is believed that in Alzheimer's disease (AD) some areas of the brain are particularly vulnerable to specific degenerative processes and that they could exhibit neuronal dysfunction in the earliest stage of the disease. The implications of the hippocampus in memory processes are very well known and it is likely that the hippocampus would be among the first areas of the brain affected by the pathogenic mechanisms occurring in AD. However, the distinction between the neurodegenerative changes that accompany normal ageing and those that characterize AD is not clear. Also, the distribution of the hippocampal cell loss in both normal aging and AD is not very well understood.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this context, we focused on the quantification of the neuronal density in the four specific areas of the hippocampus (CA1-CA4) of AD brains, as compared to an age-matched control group, by using the Nissl staining technique.
RESULTS: We found a significant reduction of neuronal density especially in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas. The most prominent decrease was found at the CA1 area level, as compared to all other 3 areas which were analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we managed to demonstrate and confirm a significant neuronal loss of hippocampus in AD, as compared to an age-matched control group. Moreover, it seems that this decrease of hippocampal neuronal density is more prominent especially at the CA1 and also in the CA3 hippocampal areas. This could have important implications in the design of therapeutic and investigative strategies of AD. However, larger samples are necessary in order to provide the basis for firmer conclusions in this area of research.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The pathologic validation of European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Center Harmonized Hippocampal Segmentation Protocol (HarP).
METHODS: Temporal lobes of nine Alzheimer's disease (AD) and seven cognitively normal subjects were scanned post-mortem at 7 Tesla. Hippocampal volumes were obtained with HarP. Six-micrometer-thick hippocampal slices were stained for amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and cresyl violet. Hippocampal subfields were manually traced. Neuronal counts, Aβ, and tau burden for each hippocampal subfield were obtained.
RESULTS: We found significant correlations between hippocampal volume and Braak and Braak staging (ρ = -0.75, P = .001), tau (ρ = -0.53, P = .034), Aβ burden (ρ = -0.61, P = .012), and neuronal count (ρ = 0.77, P < .001). Exploratory subfield-wise significant associations were found for Aβ in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 (ρ = -0.58, P = .019) and subiculum (ρ = -0.75, P = .001), tau in CA2 (ρ = -0.59, P = .016), and CA3 (ρ = -0.5, P = .047), and neuronal count in CA1 (ρ = 0.55, P = .028), CA3 (ρ = 0.65, P = .006), and CA4 (ρ = 0.76, P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations provide pathological confirmation of hippocampal morphometry as a valid biomarker for AD and pathologic validation of HarP.},

@article{jack12,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A workgroup commissioned by the Alzheimer's Association (AA) and the National Institute on Aging (NIA) recently published research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). We performed a preliminary assessment of these guidelines.
METHODS: We employed Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as our biomarker of cerebral amyloidosis, and (18) fluorodeoxyglucose PET imaging and hippocampal volume as biomarkers of neurodegeneration. A group of 42 clinically diagnosed AD subjects was used to create imaging biomarker cutpoints. A group of 450 cognitively normal (CN) subjects from a population-based sample was used to develop cognitive cutpoints and to assess population frequencies of the different preclinical AD stages using different cutpoint criteria.
RESULTS: The new criteria subdivide the preclinical phase of AD into stages 1 to 3. To classify our CN subjects, 2 additional categories were needed. Stage 0 denotes subjects with normal AD biomarkers and no evidence of subtle cognitive impairment. Suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP) denotes subjects with normal amyloid PET imaging, but abnormal neurodegeneration biomarker studies. At fixed cutpoints corresponding to 90% sensitivity for diagnosing AD and the 10th percentile of CN cognitive scores, 43% of our sample was classified as stage 0, 16% stage 1, 12 % stage 2, 3% stage 3, and 23% SNAP.
INTERPRETATION: This cross-sectional evaluation of the NIA-AA criteria for preclinical AD indicates that the 1-3 staging criteria coupled with stage 0 and SNAP categories classify 97% of CN subjects from a population-based sample, leaving only 3% unclassified. Future longitudinal validation of the criteria will be important.},

	Abstract = {Recent literature has examined baseline hippocampal volume and extent of brain amyloidosis to test potential synergistic effects on worsening cognition and extent of brain atrophy. Use of hippocampal volume in prior studies was based on the notion that limbic circuit degeneration is an early manifestation of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathophysiology. To clarify these interactions early in the AD process, we tested the effects of amyloid and baseline normalized hippocampal volume on longitudinal brain atrophy rates in a group of cognitively normal individuals. Results showed that the combination of elevated β-amyloid and baseline hippocampal atrophy is associated with increased rates specific to the limbic circuit and splenium. Importantly, this atrophy pattern emerged from a voxelwise analysis, corroborated by regression models over region of interests in native space. The results are broadly consistent with previous studies of the effects of amyloid and baseline hippocampal atrophy in normals, while pointing to accelerated atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions detectable at the preclinical stage.},

	Abstract = {We recommend a new term, "primary age-related tauopathy" (PART), to describe a pathology that is commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals. Many autopsy studies have reported brains with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are indistinguishable from those of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in the absence of amyloid (Aβ) plaques. For these "NFT+/Aβ-" brains, for which formal criteria for AD neuropathologic changes are not met, the NFTs are mostly restricted to structures in the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, brainstem, and olfactory areas (bulb and cortex). Symptoms in persons with PART usually range from normal to amnestic cognitive changes, with only a minority exhibiting profound impairment. Because cognitive impairment is often mild, existing clinicopathologic designations, such as "tangle-only dementia" and "tangle-predominant senile dementia", are imprecise and not appropriate for most subjects. PART is almost universally detectable at autopsy among elderly individuals, yet this pathological process cannot be specifically identified pre-mortem at the present time. Improved biomarkers and tau imaging may enable diagnosis of PART in clinical settings in the future. Indeed, recent studies have identified a common biomarker profile consisting of temporal lobe atrophy and tauopathy without evidence of Aβ accumulation. For both researchers and clinicians, a revised nomenclature will raise awareness of this extremely common pathologic change while providing a conceptual foundation for future studies. Prior reports that have elucidated features of the pathologic entity we refer to as PART are discussed, and working neuropathological diagnostic criteria are proposed.},

	Abstract = {The pathology-based classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases is a work in progress that is important for both clinicians and basic scientists. Analyses of large autopsy series, biomarker studies, and genomics analyses have provided important insights about AD and shed light on previously unrecognized conditions, enabling a deeper understanding of neurodegenerative diseases in general. After demonstrating the importance of correct disease classification for AD and primary age-related tauopathy, we emphasize the public health impact of an underappreciated AD "mimic," which has been termed "hippocampal sclerosis of aging" or "hippocampal sclerosis dementia." This pathology affects >20% of individuals older than 85 years and is strongly associated with cognitive impairment. In this review, we provide an overview of current hypotheses about how genetic risk factors (GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and KCNMB2), and other pathogenetic influences contribute to TDP-43 pathology and hippocampal sclerosis. Because hippocampal sclerosis of aging affects the "oldest-old" with arteriolosclerosis and TDP-43 pathologies that extend well beyond the hippocampus, more appropriate terminology for this disease is required. We recommend "cerebral age-related TDP-43 and sclerosis" (CARTS). A detailed case report is presented, which includes neuroimaging and longitudinal neurocognitive data. Finally, we suggest a neuropathology-based diagnostic rubric for CARTS.},

	Abstract = {Sporadic Parkinson's disease involves multiple neuronal systems and results from changes developing in a few susceptible types of nerve cells. Essential for neuropathological diagnosis are alpha-synuclein-immunopositive Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies. The pathological process targets specific induction sites: lesions initially occur in the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves and anterior olfactory nucleus. Thereafter, less vulnerable nuclear grays and cortical areas gradually become affected. The disease process in the brain stem pursues an ascending course with little interindividual variation. The pathology in the anterior olfactory nucleus makes fewer incursions into related areas than that developing in the brain stem. Cortical involvement ensues, beginning with the anteromedial temporal mesocortex. From there, the neocortex succumbs, commencing with high order sensory association and prefrontal areas. First order sensory association/premotor areas and primary sensory/motor fields then follow suit. This study traces the course of the pathology in incidental and symptomatic Parkinson cases proposing a staging procedure based upon the readily recognizable topographical extent of the lesions.},

	Abstract = {Since the introduction of amyloid imaging nearly 10 years ago, this technique has gained widespread use and acceptance. More recently, published reports have begun to appear in which amyloid imaging is used to detect the effects of antiamyloid therapies. This review will consider the issues involved in the use of amyloid imaging in the development and evaluation of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence regarding the postmortem correlates of in vivo amyloid imaging data are considered. The application of amyloid imaging to screening subjects for trials and use as an outcome measure is discussed in light of longitudinal changes in the in vivo amyloid signal. While the bulk of this review is directed at symptomatic patients with dementia, consideration is given to the use of amyloid imaging in nondemented subjects as well. Similarities and differences of cerebral amyloid assessment by amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements are delineated and an agenda for further research to improve the applicability of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) to clinical trials is proposed.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether longitudinal declines in cognition are associated with higher fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in vivo in individuals without dementia.
METHOD: [(11)C]PiB images were obtained to measure fibrillar Abeta burden in 57 participants without dementia from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants (33 men, 24 women) had a mean (SD) age of 78.7 (6.2) years. Six participants (4 men, 2 women) had mild cognitive impairment defined as Clinical Dementia Rating = 0.5. To measure [(11)C]PiB retention, distribution volume ratios (DVR) for 15 regions of interest were estimated by fitting a simplified reference tissue model to the measured time activity curves. Mixed effects regression was used to predict cognitive trajectories over time using data before and including time of PiB (mean follow-up 10.8 years), with mean cortical DVR, age at baseline, sex, and education as independent predictors. Voxel-based analysis identified local associations.
RESULTS: [(11)C]PiB retention was higher in older individuals. Greater declines over time in mental status and verbal learning and memory, but not visual memory, were associated significantly with higher PiB retention. Voxel-based analysis showed significant associations in frontal and lateral temporal regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher Abeta deposition is associated with greater longitudinal decline in mental status and verbal memory in the preceding years. The differential association for verbal but not visual memory may reflect the greater reliance of verbal word list learning on prefrontal regions, which show early Abeta deposition. Prospective imaging may help distinguish between individuals with evolving neuropathology who develop accelerated cognitive decline vs those with normal aging.},

	Abstract = {Regions of the temporal and parietal lobes are particularly damaged in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this leads to a predictable pattern of brain atrophy. In vivo quantification of subregional atrophy, such as changes in cortical thickness or structure volume, could lead to improved diagnosis and better assessment of the neuroprotective effects of a therapy. Toward this end, we have developed a fast and robust method for accurately quantifying cerebral structural changes in several cortical and subcortical regions using serial MRI scans. In 169 healthy controls, 299 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 129 subjects with AD, we measured rates of subregional cerebral volume change for each cohort and performed power calculations to identify regions that would provide the most sensitive outcome measures in clinical trials of disease-modifying agents. Consistent with regional specificity of AD, temporal-lobe cortical regions showed the greatest disease-related changes and significantly outperformed any of the clinical or cognitive measures examined for both AD and MCI. Global measures of change in brain structure, including whole-brain and ventricular volumes, were also elevated in AD and MCI, but were less salient when compared to changes in normal subjects. Therefore, these biomarkers are less powerful for quantifying disease-modifying effects of compounds that target AD pathology. The findings indicate that regional temporal lobe cortical changes would have great utility as outcome measures in clinical trials and may also have utility in clinical practice for aiding early diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease.},

	Abstract = {This paper uses diffeomorphometry methods to quantify the order in which statistically significant morphometric change occurs in three medial temporal lobe regions, the amygdala, entorhinal cortex (ERC), and hippocampus among subjects with symptomatic and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). Magnetic resonance imaging scans were examined in subjects who were cognitively normal at baseline, some of whom subsequently developed clinical symptoms of AD. The images were mapped to a common template, using shape-based diffeomorphometry. The multidimensional shape markers indexed through the temporal lobe structures were modeled using a changepoint model with explicit parameters, specifying the number of years preceding clinical symptom onset. Our model assumes that the atrophy rate of a considered brain structure increases years before detectable symptoms. The results demonstrate that the atrophy changepoint in the ERC occurs first, indicating significant change 8-10 years prior to onset, followed by the hippocampus, 2-4 years prior to onset, followed by the amygdala, 3 years prior to onset. The ERC is significant bilaterally, in both our local and global measures, with estimates of ERC surface area loss of 2.4% (left side) and 1.6% (right side) annually. The same changepoint model for ERC volume gives 3.0% and 2.7% on the left and right sides, respectively. Understanding the order in which changes in the brain occur during preclinical AD may assist in the design of intervention trials aimed at slowing the evolution of the disease.},

@article{fjell14,
	Abstract = {Does accelerated cortical atrophy in aging, especially in areas vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease (AD), unequivocally signify neurodegenerative disease or can it be part of normal aging? We addressed this in 3 ways. First, age trajectories of cortical thickness were delineated cross-sectionally (n = 1100) and longitudinally (n = 207). Second, effects of undetected AD on the age trajectories were simulated by mixing the sample with a sample of patients with very mild to moderate AD. Third, atrophy in AD-vulnerable regions was examined in older adults with very low probability of incipient AD based on 2-year neuropsychological stability, CSF Aβ(1-42) levels, and apolipoprotein ε4 negativity. Steady decline was seen in most regions, but accelerated cortical thinning in entorhinal cortex was observed across groups. Very low-risk older adults had longitudinal entorhinal atrophy rates similar to other healthy older adults, and this atrophy was predictive of memory change. While steady decline in cortical thickness is the norm in aging, acceleration in AD-prone regions does not uniquely signify neurodegenerative illness but can be part of healthy aging. The relationship between the entorhinal changes and changes in memory performance suggests that non-AD mechanisms in AD-prone areas may still be causative for cognitive reductions.},

	Abstract = {IMPORTANCE: The appearance of β-amyloidosis and brain injury biomarkers in cognitively normal (CN) persons is thought to define risk for the future development of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer disease (AD), but their interaction is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the joint presence of β-amyloidosis and brain injury biomarkers would lead to more rapid neurodegeneration. DESIGN Longitudinal cohort study.
SETTING: Population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ninety-one CN persons (median age, 77 years; range, 71-93 years) in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent magnetic resonance, fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging at least twice 15 months apart. Participants were grouped according to the recommendations of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association preclinical AD criteria based on the presence of β-amyloidosis, defined as a PiB PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) greater than 1.5, alone (stage 1) or with brain injury (stage 2 + 3), defined as hippocampal atrophy or FDG hypometabolism. We also studied a group of patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 17) or dementia (n = 9) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or the Mayo Alzheimer Center with similar follow-up times who had undergone comparable imaging and had a PiB PET SUVr greater than 1.5.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Rate of change of cortical volume on volumetric magnetic resonance images and rate of change of glucose metabolism on FDG PET scan results.
RESULTS: There were 25 CN participants with both high PiB retention and low hippocampal volume or FDG hypometabolism at baseline (preclinical AD stages 2 + 3). On follow-up scans, the preclinical AD stage 2 + 3 participants had greater loss of medial temporal lobe volume and greater glucose hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe compared with the other CN groups. The changes were similar to those in the cognitively impaired participants. Extratemporal regions did not show similar changes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Higher rates of medial temporal neurodegeneration occur in CN individuals who, on their initial scans, had abnormal levels of both β-amyloid and brain injury biomarkers. Although preclinical AD is currently only a research topic, the description of its brain structural changes will be critical for trials designed to prevent or forestall dementia due to AD.},

	Abstract = {Cross sectional studies of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) have identified several brain regions known to be prone to degeneration suitable as biomarkers, including hippocampal, ventricular, and whole brain volume. The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate an index based on morphometric measures derived from MRI data that could be used for classification of AD and healthy control subjects, as well as prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Patients originated from the AddNeuroMed project at baseline (119 AD, 119 MCI, 110 controls (CTL)) and 1-year follow-up (62 AD, 73 MCI, 79 CTL). Data consisted of 3D T1-weighted MR images, demographics, MMSE, ADAS-Cog, CERAD and CDR scores, and APOE e4 status. We computed an index using a multivariate classification model (AD vs. CTL), using orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS). Sensitivity, specificity and AUC were determined. Performance of the classifier (AD vs. CTL) was high at baseline (10-fold cross-validation, 84% sensitivity, 91% specificity, 0.93 AUC) and at 1-year follow-up (92% sensitivity, 74% specificity, 0.93 AUC). Predictions of conversion from MCI to AD were good at baseline (77% of MCI converters) and at follow-up (91% of MCI converters). MCI carriers of the APOE e4 allele manifested more atrophy and presented a faster cognitive decline when compared to non-carriers. The derived index demonstrated a steady increase in atrophy over time, yielding higher accuracy in prediction at the time of clinical conversion. Neuropsychological tests appeared less sensitive to changes over time. However, taking the average of the two time points yielded better correlation between the index and cognitive scores as opposed to using cross-sectional data only. Thus, multivariate classification seemed to detect patterns of AD changes before conversion from MCI to AD and including longitudinal information is of great importance.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is one of the hottest regions in neuroscience because it is critical to learning, memory, and cognition, while being vulnerable to many neurological and mental disorders. With increasing high-resolution imaging techniques, many scientists have started to use distinct landmarks along the anterior-posterior axis of HF to allow segmentation into individual subfields in order to identify specific functions in both normal and diseased conditions. These studies urgently call for more reliable and accurate segmentation of the HF subfields DG, CA3, CA2, CA1, prosubiculum, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. Unfortunately, very limited data are available on detailed parcellation of the HF subfields, especially in the complex, curved hippocampal head region. In this study we revealed detailed organization and parcellation of all subfields of the hippocampal head and body regions on the base of a combined analysis of multiple cyto- and chemoarchitectural stains and dense sequential section sampling. We also correlated these subfields to macro-anatomical landmarks, which are visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Furthermore, we created three versions of the detailed anatomic atlas for the hippocampal head region to account for brains with four, three, or two hippocampal digitations. These results will provide a fundamental basis for understanding the organization, parcellation, and anterior-posterior difference of human HF, facilitating accurate segmentation and measurement of HF subfields in the human brain on MRI scans.},

	Abstract = {Digital image analysis of histology sections provides reliable, high-throughput methods for neuropathological studies but data is scant in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which has an added challenge of study due to morphologically diverse pathologies. Here, we describe a novel method of semi-automated digital image analysis in FTLD subtypes including: Pick's disease (PiD, n=11) with tau-positive intracellular inclusions and neuropil threads, and TDP-43 pathology type C (FTLD-TDPC, n=10), defined by TDP-43-positive aggregates predominantly in large dystrophic neurites. To do this, we examined three FTLD-associated cortical regions: mid-frontal gyrus (MFG), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) by immunohistochemistry. We used a color deconvolution process to isolate signal from the chromogen and applied both object detection and intensity thresholding algorithms to quantify pathological burden. We found object-detection algorithms had good agreement with gold-standard manual quantification of tau- and TDP-43-positive inclusions. Our sampling method was reliable across three separate investigators and we obtained similar results in a pilot analysis using open-source software. Regional comparisons using these algorithms finds differences in regional anatomic disease burden between PiD and FTLD-TDP not detected using traditional ordinal scale data, suggesting digital image analysis is a powerful tool for clinicopathological studies in morphologically diverse FTLD syndromes.},

For example, cortical thickness in one region influences the thickness of structurally and functionally connected regions. Such networks of structural co-variance partially recapitulate the functional networks of healthy individuals and the foci of grey matter loss in neurodegenerative disease. This architecture is genetically heritable, is associated with behavioural and cognitive abilities and is changed systematically across the lifespan. The biological meaning of this structural co-variance remains controversial, but it appears to reflect developmental coordination or synchronized maturation between areas of the brain.

	Abstract = {Recent research on Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown that cognitive and memory decline in this disease is accompanied by disrupted changes in the coordination of large-scale brain functional networks. However, alterations in coordinated patterns of structural brain networks in AD are still poorly understood. Here, we used cortical thickness measurement from magnetic resonance imaging to investigate large-scale structural brain networks in 92 AD patients and 97 normal controls. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding cortical thickness correlation matrices of 54 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with controls, AD patients showed decreased cortical thickness intercorrelations between the bilateral parietal regions and increased intercorrelations in several selective regions involving the lateral temporal and parietal cortex as well as the cingulate and medial frontal cortex regions. Specially, AD patients showed abnormal small-world architecture in the structural cortical networks (increased clustering and shortest paths linking individual regions), implying a less optimal topological organization in AD. Moreover, AD patients were associated with reduced nodal centrality predominantly in the temporal and parietal heteromodal association cortex regions and increased nodal centrality in the occipital cortex regions. Finally, the brain networks of AD were about equally as robust to random failures as those of controls, but more vulnerable against targeted attacks, presumably because of the effects of pathological topological organization. Our findings suggest that the coordinated patterns of cortical morphology are widely altered in AD patients, thus providing structural evidence for disrupted integrity in large-scale brain networks that underlie cognition. This work has implications for our understanding of how functional deficits in patients are associated with their underlying structural (morphological) basis.},

	Abstract = {Assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neurofibrillary pathology requires a procedure that permits a sufficient differentiation between initial, intermediate, and late stages. The gradual deposition of a hyperphosphorylated tau protein within select neuronal types in specific nuclei or areas is central to the disease process. The staging of AD-related neurofibrillary pathology originally described in 1991 was performed on unconventionally thick sections (100 mum) using a modern silver technique and reflected the progress of the disease process based chiefly on the topographic expansion of the lesions. To better meet the demands of routine laboratories this procedure is revised here by adapting tissue selection and processing to the needs of paraffin-embedded sections (5-15 mum) and by introducing a robust immunoreaction (AT8) for hyperphosphorylated tau protein that can be processed on an automated basis. It is anticipated that this revised methodological protocol will enable a more uniform application of the staging procedure.},

@article{thal02,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deposition of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a histopathologic hallmark of AD. The regions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are hierarchically involved in Abeta-deposition.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether there is a hierarchical involvement of the regions of the entire brain as well and whether there are differences in the expansion of Abeta-pathology between clinically proven AD cases and nondemented cases with AD-related pathology, the authors investigated 47 brains from demented and nondemented patients with AD-related pathology covering all phases of beta-amyloidosis in the MTL (AbetaMTL phases) and four control brains without any AD-related pathology.
METHODS: Abeta deposits were detected by the use of the Campbell-Switzer silver technique and by immunohistochemistry in sections covering all brain regions and brainstem nuclei. It was analyzed how often distinct regions exhibited Abeta deposits.
RESULTS: In the first of five phases in the evolution of beta-amyloidosis Abeta deposits are found exclusively in the neocortex. The second phase is characterized by the additional involvement of allocortical brain regions. In phase 3, diencephalic nuclei, the striatum, and the cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain exhibit Abeta deposits as well. Several brainstem nuclei become additionally involved in phase 4. Phase 5, finally, is characterized by cerebellar Abeta-deposition. The 17 clinically proven AD cases exhibit Abeta-phases 3, 4, or 5. The nine nondemented cases with AD-related Abeta pathology show Abeta-phases 1, 2, or 3.
CONCLUSIONS: Abeta-deposition in the entire brain follows a distinct sequence in which the regions are hierarchically involved. Abeta-deposition, thereby, expands anterogradely into regions that receive neuronal projections from regions already exhibiting Abeta. There are also indications that clinically proven AD cases with full-blown beta-amyloidosis may be preceded in early stages by nondemented cases exhibiting AD-related Abeta pathology.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we update the TDP-43 in Alzheimer's disease staging scheme by assessing the topography of TDP-43 in 193 cases of Alzheimer's disease, in 14 different brain regions (eight previously described plus six newly reported) and use conditional probability to model the spread of TDP-43 across the 14 brain regions. We show that in addition to the eight original regions we previously reported [amygdala, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, occipitotemporal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, middle frontal cortex and basal ganglia (putamen/globus pallidum)] that TDP-43 is also deposited in the insular cortex, ventral striatum, basal forebrain, substantia nigra, midbrain tectum, and the inferior olive of the medulla oblongata, in Alzheimer's disease. The conditional probability analysis produced six significantly different stages (P < 0.01), and suggests that TDP-43 deposition begins in the amygdala (stage 1), then moves to entorhinal cortex and subiculum (stage 2); to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and occipitotemporal cortex (stage 3); insular cortex, ventral striatum, basal forebrain and inferior temporal cortex (stage 4); substantia nigra, inferior olive and midbrain tectum (stage 5); and finally to basal ganglia and middle frontal cortex (stage 6). This updated staging scheme is superior to our previous staging scheme, classifying 100 % of the cases (versus 94 % in the old scheme), based on criteria provided, and shows clinical significance with some regions and with increasing stage. We discuss the relevance of the updated staging scheme, as well as its impact on the prion-like hypothesis of protein spread in neurodegenerative disease. We also address the issue of whether frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 could be the primary pathology in stage 6.},

	Abstract = {TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been heavily researched in recent years due to its involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Several studies have also sought to investigate the frequency of TDP-43 deposition in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but there has been relatively little work focused on the prevalence, distribution and histopathological associations of abnormal TDP-43 deposits in the brains of cognitively normal elderly subjects. We screened thick, free-floating coronal sections of mesial temporal lobe from 110 prospectively followed and autopsied cognitively normal subjects (age range 71-100 years) using an immunohistochemical method for phosphorylated TDP-43. We found a 36.4 % prevalence of pathologic TDP-43, mostly in the form of neurites while perikaryal cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions were uncommon and intranuclear inclusions were rare. With respect to other concomitant pathologies commonly found in elderly individuals, cases with TDP-43 had a greater prevalence of argyrophilic grains (ARG) (40 vs. 18.6 %) and overall ARG density (moderate vs. sparse). There were no additional associations with other concomitant pathologies, including cerebral white matter rarefaction, incidental Lewy bodies, neurofibrillary tangles or amyloid plaques. These results indicate deposition of TDP-43 occurs in a substantial subset of cognitively normal elderly subjects and is more common in those with ARG, supporting some previous studies linking pathological TDP-43 deposition with ARG and other pathological tau protein deposits.},

	Abstract = {Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are the hallmark neuropathologic findings in Parkinson disease, Parkinson disease with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other alpha-synucleinopathies. They have also been described in the brains of normal older individuals and referred to as incidental Lewy body disease. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (Lewy body pathology [LBP]) in 139 autopsies from our normal volunteer control group of the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center. All subjects were followed longitudinally and were cognitively normal and without any type of movement disorder, neuropsychiatric features, or other CNS findings. The brains of 33 of 139 normal subjects contained LBP in various regions. The most common regions involved were the medulla (26%), amygdala (24%), pons (20%), and midbrain (20%). No mean statistical differences were found between those with and without LBP on any demographic or cognitive variable, Braak stage, or neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque quantitation. An explanation for the high prevalence of LBP in our elderly, well-educated study group is not clear, although it does not seem to be related to aging or the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology. Overall, our findings support the concept that incidental Lewy body disease most likely represents preclinical or presymptomatic Parkinson disease, Parkinson disease with dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies.},

@article{zaccai08,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is proposed that alpha-synucleinopathy (AS) initially affects the medulla oblongata and progresses to more rostral brain areas in a hierarchical sequence ("Braak hypothesis"). Predominant involvement of the amygdala is also described. This study examines the applicability of these patterns, and their relationship to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology, in brains of a population-based donor cohort.
METHODS: Brains donated in two of six Cognitive Function and Ageing Study cohorts (Cambridgeshire and Nottingham) were examined. More than 80% were older than 80 years at death. The respondents were evaluated prospectively in life for cognitive decline and dementia. Immunocytochemistry for tau and alpha-synuclein was carried out in 208 brains to establish Braak stage and the pattern and severity of AS.
RESULTS: Seventy-six brains showed Lewy bodies. Half (51%) conformed to the Braak hypothesis while 17% had pathology in a higher region which was absent in a lower region. A further 29% showed amygdala-predominant pathology. Six brains showed predominant neocortical pathology with minimal pathology in amygdala or substantia nigra. The stage of AD pathology was not associated with particular patterns of AS.
CONCLUSION: alpha-Synucleinopathy (AS) is common in older people, and frequently associated with Alzheimer disease-type pathology. Although half of brains corresponded to the Braak hypothesis, and 29% to amygdala-predominant AS, there were a high proportion of cases which did not fit a staging system. An unexpectedly high proportion with a cortical form of Lewy body disease was identified.},

	Abstract = {The association between small but still visible lacunar infarcts and cognitive decline has been established by population-based radiological and pathological studies. Microscopic examination of brain sections shows even smaller but substantially more numerous microinfarcts, the focus of this Review. These lesions often result from small vessel pathologies such as arteriolosclerosis or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. They typically go undetected in clinical-radiological correlation studies that rely on conventional structural MRI, although the largest acute microinfarcts can be detected by diffusion-weighted imaging. In view of their high numbers and widespread distribution, microinfarcts could directly disrupt important cognitive networks and thus account for some of the neurological dysfunction associated with lesions visible on conventional MRI such as lacunar infarcts and white matter hyperintensities. Standardised neuropathological assessment criteria and the development of non-invasive means of detection during life would be major steps towards understanding the causes and consequences of otherwise macroscopically invisible microinfarcts.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: One in 3 individuals will experience a stroke, dementia or both. Moreover, twice as many individuals will have cognitive impairment short of dementia as either stroke or dementia. The commonly used stroke scales do not measure cognition, while dementia criteria focus on the late stages of cognitive impairment, and are heavily biased toward the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. No commonly agreed standards exist for identifying and describing individuals with cognitive impairment, particularly in the early stages, and especially with cognitive impairment related to vascular factors, or vascular cognitive impairment.
METHODS: The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the Canadian Stroke Network (CSN) convened researchers in clinical diagnosis, epidemiology, neuropsychology, brain imaging, neuropathology, experimental models, biomarkers, genetics, and clinical trials to recommend minimum, common, clinical and research standards for the description and study of vascular cognitive impairment.
RESULTS: The results of these discussions are reported herein.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of common standards represents a first step in a process of use, validation and refinement. Using the same standards will help identify individuals in the early stages of cognitive impairment, will make studies comparable, and by integrating knowledge, will accelerate the pace of progress.},

	Abstract = {The Neuropathology Task Force of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) has developed a practical and standardized neuropathology protocol for the postmortem assessment of dementia and control subjects. The protocol provides neuropathologic definitions of such terms as "definite Alzheimer's disease" (AD), "probable AD," "possible AD," and "normal brain" to indicate levels of diagnostic certainty, reduce subjective interpretation, and assure common language. To pretest the protocol, neuropathologists from 15 participating centers entered information on autopsy brains from 142 demented patients clinically diagnosed as probable AD and on eight nondemented patients. Eighty-four percent of the dementia cases fulfilled CERAD neuropathologic criteria for definite AD. As increasingly large numbers of prospectively studied dementia and control subjects are autopsied, the CERAD neuropathology protocol will help to refine diagnostic criteria, assess overlapping pathology, and lead to a better understanding of early subclinical changes of AD and normal aging.},

	Abstract = {Interfacing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with pathology is critically important for understanding the pathologic basis of MRI signal changes in vivo and for clinicopathologic correlations. Postmortem MRI is an intermediate step in this process; unfortunately, however, relating the data to standard pathologic sections, which are relatively thick and often nonparallel, is both time-consuming and insufficiently accurate. The aim of this project was to develop technology to integrate postmortem, high-resolution, whole-brain MRI into the planning and execution of pathologic analysis through precise localization of the target and coordinates of cut. Compared with standard pathologic sectioning, the use of an individualized, 3-dimensionally printed cutting box-designed based on postmortem MRI of formalin-fixed whole brains-improved the speed, quality, and accuracy of radiologic-pathologic correlations and, specifically, the histopathologic localization of imaging findings. The technology described herein is easily implemented, applicable to any brain disorder, and potentially extendable to other organs. From the point of view of the pathologist, this technique can improve localization of small or subtle abnormalities, whereas from the point of view of the radiologist, it has the potential to improve understanding of MRI signal changes observed in diseases.},

This paper presents a unified computational and statistical framework for modeling amygdala shape variations in a clinical population. The weighted spherical harmonic representation is used to parameterize, smooth out, and normalize amygdala surfaces. The representation is subsequently used as an input for multivariate linear models accounting for nuisance covariates such as age and brain size difference using the SurfStat package that completely avoids the complexity of specifying design matrices. The methodology has been applied for quantifying abnormal local amygdala shape variations in 22 high functioning autistic subjects.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel, computerized method of examining cerebral cortical thickness. The normal cortex varies in thickness from 2 to 4 mm, reflecting the morphology of neuronal sublayers. Cortical pathologies often manifest abnormal variations in thickness, with examples of Alzheimer's disease and cortical dysplasia as thin and thick cortex, respectively. Radiologically, images are 2-D slices through a highly convoluted 3-D object. Depending on the relative orientation of the slices with respect to the object, it is impossible to deduce abnormal cortical thickness without additional information from neighboring slices. We approach the problem by applying Laplace's Equation (V2psi = 0) from mathematical physics. The volume of the cortex is represented as the domain for the solution of the differential equation, with separate boundary conditions at the gray-white junction and the gray-CSF junction. Normalized gradients of psi form a vector field, representing tangent vectors along field lines connecting both boundaries. We define the cortical thickness at any point in the cortex to be the pathlength along such lines. Key advantages of this method are that it is fully three-dimensional, and the thickness is uniquely defined for any point in the cortex. We present graphical results that map cortical thickness everywhere in a normal brain. Results show global variations in cortical thickness consistent with known neuroanatomy. The application of this technique to visualization of cortical thickness in brains with known pathology has broad clinical implications.},

Typically, the tumor volume is computed on a slice-by-slice basis using MRI scans obtained at regular intervals. (3D)Slicer - a free platform for biomedical research - provides an alternative to this manual slice-by-slice segmentation process, which is significantly faster and requires less user interaction. In this study, 4 physicians segmented GBMs in 10 patients, once using the competitive region-growing based GrowCut segmentation module of Slicer, and once purely by drawing boundaries completely manually on a slice-by-slice basis. Furthermore, we provide a variability analysis for three physicians for 12 GBMs. The time required for GrowCut segmentation was on an average 61% of the time required for a pure manual segmentation. A comparison of Slicer-based segmentation with manual slice-by-slice segmentation resulted in a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 88.43 $\pm$ 5.23% and a Hausdorff Distance of 2.32 $\pm$ 5.23 mm.},

Twenty state-of-the-art tumor segmentation algorithms were applied to a set of 65 multi-contrast MR scans of low- and high-grade glioma patients-manually annotated by up to four raters-and to 65 comparable scans generated using tumor image simulation software. Quantitative evaluations revealed considerable disagreement between the human raters in segmenting various tumor sub-regions (Dice scores in the range 74%-85%), illustrating the difficulty of this task. We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our aim is to assess the subfield-specific histopathological correlates of hippocampal volume and intensity changes (T1, T2) as well as diff!usion MRI markers in TLE, and investigate the efficacy of quantitative MRI measures in predicting histopathology in vivo.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We correlated in vivo volumetry, T2 signal, quantitative T1 mapping, as well as diffusion MRI parameters with histological features of hippocampal sclerosis in a subfield-specific manner. We made use of on an advanced co-registration pipeline that provided a seamless integration of preoperative 3 T MRI with postoperative histopathological data, on which metrics of cell loss and gliosis were quantitatively assessed in CA1, CA2/3, and CA4/DG.
PRINCIPAL OBSERVATIONS: MRI volumes across all subfields were positively correlated with neuronal density and size. Higher T2 intensity related to increased GFAP fraction in CA1, while quantitative T1 and diffusion MRI parameters showed negative correlations with neuronal density in CA4 and DG. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that in vivo multiparametric MRI can predict neuronal loss in all the analyzed subfields with up to 90% accuracy.
CONCLUSION: Our results, based on an accurate co-registration pipeline and a subfield-specific analysis of MRI and histology, demonstrate the potential of MRI volumetry, diffusion, and quantitative T1 as accurate in vivo biomarkers of hippocampal pathology.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High resolution 7T MRI is increasingly used to investigate hippocampal subfields in vivo, but most studies rely on manual segmentation which is labor intensive. We aimed to evaluate an automated technique to segment hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex at 7T MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex were manually segmented, covering most of the long axis of the hippocampus on 0.70-mm(3) T2-weighted 7T images of 26 participants (59 $\pm$ 9 years, 46% men). The automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields approach was applied and evaluated by using leave-one-out cross-validation.
RESULTS: Comparison of automated segmentations with corresponding manual segmentations yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of >0.75 for CA1, the dentate gyrus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex and >0.54 for CA2 and CA3. Intraclass correlation coefficients were >0.74 for CA1, the dentate gyrus, and subiculum; and >0.43 for CA2, CA3, and the entorhinal cortex. Restricting the comparison of the entorhinal cortex segmentation to a smaller range along the anteroposterior axis improved both intraclass correlation coefficients (left: 0.71; right: 0.82) and Dice similarity coefficients (left: 0.78; right: 0.77). The accuracy of the automated segmentation versus a manual rater was lower, though only slightly for most subfields, than the intrarater reliability of an expert manual rater, but it was similar to or slightly higher than the accuracy of an expert-versus-manual rater with ∼170 hours of training for almost all subfields.
CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a computational technique to automatically label hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex at 7T MRI, with a high accuracy for most subfields that is competitive with the labor-intensive manual segmentation. The software and atlas are publicly available: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/ashs/.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal atrophy, as evidenced using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is one of the most validated, easily accessible and widely used biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its imperfect sensitivity and specificity have highlighted the need to improve the analysis of MRI data. Based on neuropathological data showing a differential vulnerability of hippocampal subfields to AD processes, neuroimaging researchers have tried to capture corresponding morphological changes within the hippocampus. The present review provides an overview of the methodological developments that allow the assessment of hippocampal subfield morphology in vivo, and summarizes the results of studies looking at the effects of AD and normal aging on these structures. Most studies highlighted a focal atrophy of the CA1 subfield in the early (predementia or even preclinical) stages of AD, before atrophy becomes more widespread at the dementia stage, consistent with the pathological literature. Preliminary studies have indicated that looking at this focal atrophy pattern rather than standard whole hippocampus volumetry improves diagnostic accuracy at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. However, controversies remain regarding changes in hippocampal subfield structure in normal aging and regarding correlations between specific subfield volume and memory abilities, very likely because of the strong methodological variability between studies. Overall, hippocampal subfield analysis has proven to be a promising technique in the study of AD. However, harmonization of segmentation protocols and studies on larger samples are needed to enable accurate comparisons between studies and to confirm the clinical utility of these techniques.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is among the most serious complications of myocardial infarction which doubles the late mortality; mainly treated by undersizing ring annuloplasty. To find some preoperative echocardiographic indices that predict immediate failure of mitral valve annuloplasty (MVA), we designed the present study with more focusing on some novel parameters.
METHOD: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) indices of consecutive patients referred with 3+ or 4+ IMR were registered 24 hours before surgery. Thirty days later, a second TTE was performed. According to the results, the patients were categorized as the "successful" group (with 1+ or less mitral regurgitation) and the "unsuccessful" group (with 2+ or higher MR). Preoperative TTE indices were compared among the two groups using suitable statistical tests.
RESULTS: Of the total of 126 cases, 68 had successful and 58 had unsuccessful MVA. Statistically significant differences were found between the two groups for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (P = 0.007), left ventricular end systolic volume (LVESV) (P = 0.044), and basal-interpapillary muscle distance (IPMD) diastolic-to-systolic ratio (DSR) (P = 0.008). Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis demonstrated 37.5%, 3.85 cm(3) , and 1.25, as the best cutoff points for LVEF (P = 0.03, sensitivity: 81%, specificity: 69%), LVESV (P = 0.023, sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 57%), and basal-IPMD DSR (P = 0.001, sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 95%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Among all TTE indices, LVEF, LVESV, and basal-IPMD DSR were helpful to differentiate between the successful and unsuccessful MVA results. We believe the basal-IPMD DSR as a novel index could be targeted in the future studies.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network recently reported no difference in the primary end point of left ventricular end-systolic volume index at 1 year postsurgery in patients randomized to repair (n = 126) or replacement (n = 125) for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation. However, patients undergoing repair experienced significantly more recurrent mitral regurgitation than patients undergoing replacement (32.6% vs 2.3%). We examined whether baseline echocardiographic and clinical characteristics could identify those who will develop moderate/severe recurrent mitral regurgitation or die.
METHODS: Our analysis includes 116 patients who were randomized to and received mitral valve repair. Logistic regression was used to estimate a model-based probability of recurrence or death from baseline factors. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed from these estimated probabilities to determine classification cut-points maximizing accuracy of prediction based on sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: Of the 116 patients, 6 received a replacement before leaving the operating room; all other patients had mild or less mitral regurgitation on intraoperative echocardiogram after repair. During the 2-year follow-up period, 76 patients developed moderate/severe mitral regurgitation or died (53 mitral regurgitation recurrences, 13 mitral regurgitation recurrences and death, and 10 deaths). The mechanism for recurrent mitral regurgitation was largely mitral valve leaflet tethering. Our model (including age, body mass index, sex, race, effective regurgitant orifice area, basal aneurysm/dyskinesis, New York Heart Association class, history of coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, or ventricular arrhythmias) yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82.
CONCLUSIONS: The model demonstrated good discrimination in identifying patients who will survive 2 years without recurrent mitral regurgitation after mitral valve repair. Although our results require validation, they offer a clinically relevant risk score for selection of surgical candidates for this procedure.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In our study, we investigated the impact of papillary muscle systolic dyssynchrony (DYS-PAP) obtained by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) in the prediction of recurrent ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) after restrictive annuloplasty.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 524 consecutive patients who survived coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and restrictive annuloplasty, performed between 2001 and 2010 at 3 different Institutions and who met inclusion criteria. The assessment of DYS-PAP was performed preoperatively and at follow-up (median 45.3 months [IQR 26-67]) by 2D-STE in the apical four-chamber view for the anterolateral papillary muscle (ALPM) and apical long-axis view for the posteromedial papillary muscle (PMPM).
RESULTS: Recurrence of MR (≥ 2+ in patients with no/trivial MR at discharge) was found in 112 patients (21.3%) at follow-up. Compared to patients without recurrence of MR, these patients had higher DYS-PAP values at baseline (60.6 $\pm$ 4.4 ms vs. 47.2 $\pm$ 2.9 ms, p<0.001) which significantly worsened at follow-up (74.4 $\pm$ 5.2 ms, p=0.002 vs. baseline). In contrast, in patients with no MR recurrence, DYS-PAP was significantly reduced (25.3 $\pm$ 4.4 ms, p=0.002 vs. baseline). At logistic regression analysis DYS-PAP (odds ratio [OR]: 4.8, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 3.4-8.2, p<0.001), was the strongest predictor of recurrent MR with a cutoff ≥ 58 ms (95%CI 51-66 ms). The model showed an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.97 (CI 0.94-0.99 [optimism-corrected 0.94; CI 0.89-0.95]) with 98% sensitivity (CI 96-100% [optimism-corrected 95%; CI 91-96%]) and 90% specificity (CI 85-94% [optimism-corrected 87%; CI 82-90%]).
CONCLUSIONS: DYS-PAP represents a reliable tool to identify patients with ischemic MR who can benefit from restrictive annuloplasty.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: We retrospectively evaluated left atrial (LA) strain and strain rate (SR) before and after undersized mitral ring annuloplasty (UMRA) for chronic ischaemic mitral regurgitation (CIMR) with two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Left atrial volumes, LA reservoir, LA conduit, LA contractile phases, and LA ejection fraction (LAEF) were measured in 95 CIMR patients who underwent coronary bypass grafting and UMRA. Left atrial peak global strain (ε), LA reservoir (SRp), LA conduit (SRE), and LA contractile phase (SRA) strain rates were obtained at the baseline and at the follow-up (median 41.5 months, interquartile range 23-61). Based on the recurrence of mitral regurgitation (MR) at the follow-up, the patients were divided into two groups: patients with (group MR+, n = 30) or without (group MR-, n = 65) recurrent MR. Twenty age-and gender-matched healthy adults were controls. In the MR- group, baseline ε (P < 0.001), SRP (P < 0.001), SRE (P < 0.001), and SRA (P < 0.001) were enhanced, while in MR+ group, ε (P < 0.001), SRP (P = 0.03), SRE (P = 0.03), and SRA (P = 0.003) were worse than controls. At the follow-up, none of these indices changed in the MR+ group while all returned to normal values in patients belonging to the MR- group. Left atrial deformation correlated with corresponding volumetric parameters. Furthermore, we found a direct correlation between SRE and early peak diastolic velocity (E) (ρ = 0.52, P = 0.02) and E-wave deceleration time (ρ = 0.50, P = 0.02). Finally, there was a strong correlation between ε, SRP, and SRA (ρ = 0.72, P < 0.001 and ρ = 0.79, P < 0.001, respectively) and SRE (ρ = 0.69, P < 0.001 and ρ = 0.71, P < 0.001, respectively). Finally, ε, SRP, and SRE (all, P < 0.001) were co-factors associated to recurrent MR.
CONCLUSION: Left atrial peak global strain, peak systolic SR, and peak early diastolic SR were cofactors associated to recurrent MR. The assessment of LA strain and SR, in addition to other echocardiographic parameters, can be helpful in detecting patients undergoing UMRA who are unlikely to benefit from annuloplasty.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the impact of papillary muscle dyssynchrony (DYS-PAP) in predicting recurrent mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) undergoing undersized mitral ring annuloplasty (UMRA).
METHODS: One hundred forty-four ICM patients (left ventricular ejection fraction <35%) in sinus rhythm undergoing UMRA between January 2001 and December 2010 at three Institutions (University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands; Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy; Civic Hospital, Brescia, Italy) were recruited. The primary endpoint was the recurrence of MR at the latest echocardiographic study defined as insufficiency ≥2+ in patients with no/trivial MR at discharge. The assessment of DYS-PAP was performed by applying two-dimensional (2D) speckle-tracking imaging.
RESULTS: In patients with MR recurrence, DYS-PAP significantly worsened (84.1 $\pm$ 8.8 msec vs.65.4 $\pm$ 8.8 msec at baseline, P < 0.001) whereas in patients with no MR recurrence, DYS-PAP did not vary (22.3 $\pm$ 5.3 msec vs. 25.9 $\pm$ 7.2 msec at baseline, P = 0.8). Recurrent MR was positively correlated with preoperative DYS-PAP (P < 0.001), baseline anterior mitral leaflet tethering angle α (P < 0.001) and tethering symmetry index α/β before surgery (P < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between MR recurrence and other echocardiographic parameters. Logistic regression analysis revealed that baseline values of DYS-PAP (OR: 5.4 [95% CI: 3.1-7.7], P < 0.001), α (OR: 5.0 [2.6-6.7], P < 0.001), and α/β (OR: 3.9 [2.5-5.7], p < 0.001) were predictors of recurrent MR. A DYS-PAP value ≥ 58 msec predicted recurrence of MR with 100% sensitivity and 83% specificity (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 [0.7-1], P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A DYS-PAP cutoff value of 58 msec is useful to identify patients in whom UMRA is likely to fail. That way decision making in ischemic functional MR might be facilitated.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between anterior mitral leaflet (AML) tethering and recurrent ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) after restrictive annuloplasty. We also explored whether the effect of AML tethering was secondary to modifications in left ventricular size and geometry.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 435 consecutive patients with chronic ischemic MR who survived combined coronary artery bypass grafting and undersized mitral ring annuloplasty performed at 3 institutions (University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands; Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy; and Civic Hospital, Brescia, Italy) from 2001 to 2008. The median follow-up was 44.7 months (interquartile range 25.9-66.4). The patients were divided by the baseline measurements into quintiles of AML tethering angle α' as follows: group 1, normal/slight AML tethering; group 2, mild AML tethering; group 3, moderate AML tethering; group 4, moderate-to-severe AML tethering; and group 5, severe AML tethering.
RESULTS: Recurrence of MR was significantly greater in patients with moderate-to-severe (28.3%) and severe (39.4%) AML tethering (P < .001). A strong correlation was found between α' (r = 0.83, P < .001) and recurrent MR but a weak correlation with the posterior mitral angle β' (r = 0.12, P = .05). On logistic regression analysis corrected for other echocardiographic risk factors, moderate-severe AML tethering or worse (adjusted odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.0-4.1; P < .001) was a strong predictor of MR recurrence. Compared with patients with β' of 45 or greater, those with severe and moderate-severe AML tethering had more than 3.7 and 1.7 times greater odds of MR recurrence, respectively. No significant interactions were found between α' and the indexes of left ventricular function and geometry.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative moderate-severe AML tethering or worse was strongly associated with MR recurrence. Thus, assessment of leaflet tethering should be incorporated into clinical risk assessment and prediction models.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated predictive factors of postoperative recurrence of mitral regurgitation (MR) after mitral valve annuloplasty for functional ischemic MR.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of patients with functional MR who underwent mitral ring annuloplasty at our institution from 1998 to 2008. Records were reviewed for perioperative variables, including echocardiographic measurements. Recurrence was defined as MR grade moderate (3+) or greater on any postoperative echocardiogram.
RESULTS: Of 548 patients who underwent mitral annuloplasty for functional MR, echocardiogram reports were available for review for 250. These patients comprised the study cohort. There were 154 patients with concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. The left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic (LVED) index was calculated by dividing the LVED dimension by body surface area (BSA). A high LVED index (>3.5 cm/m2) was predictive of MR recurrence (p=0.047): the recurrence rate was 20.3% (13 of 64) in high-index patients and 10.2% (19 of 186) in low-index (<3.5 cm/m2) patients. Median recurrence-free survival was 35 months (range, 19 to 59 months) in high-LVED-index patients and 46.5 months (range, 22 to 75 months) in low-LVED-index patients (p=0.048). Preoperative MR severity and LV ejection fraction were not predictive of MR recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Careful analysis of the preoperative echocardiogram using a novel, easily calculated variable, the LVED index, may help identify patients who are at greater risk for MR recurrence and reduced survival. Such information could prompt consideration of alternative or additional interventions in these patients.},

METHODS: Hospital outcome and serial clinical and echocardiographic (preoperative, discharge, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months) follow-up assessments were analyzed in 87 consecutive patients with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation having coronary artery bypass grafting. Persistent/recurrent mitral regurgitation was defined by grade ≥2 at discharge/during follow-up.
RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 5.7% and persistence of regurgitation was present in 8.4%. Mean follow-up was 24.4 $\pm$ 1.7 months and recurrent mitral regurgitation was observed in 32.4% patients. In multivariate analysis only anterior leaflet angle remained an independent predictive factor for regurgitation recurrence with cutoff 27$\,^{\circ}$ (sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 76%, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: There is high occurrence of early and delayed restrictive annuloplasty failure, particularly in patients with increased anterior leaflet tethering.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this multicenter study was to investigate the impact of the preoperative anterior mitral leaflet tethering angle, α', on the recurrence of mitral regurgitation (MR) and left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling (LVRR) after undersized mitral ring annuloplasty.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 362 patients, who were divided into two groups by baseline α': group 1, α' < 39.5$\,^{\circ}$ (n = 196), and group 2, α' ≥ 39.5$\,^{\circ}$ (n = 166). End points were recurrent MR ≥ 2+; LVRR, defined as a reduction in end-systolic volume index > 15%; and LV geometric reverse remodeling, defined as a reduction in systolic sphericity index to a normal value of <0.72 in patients with altered baseline geometry.
RESULTS: MR occurred in 9.6% (n = 19) and 43.3% (n = 72) of the patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively (P < .001). LVRR (85.7% vs 22.2%) at follow-up was higher in group 1 (P < .001). On multivariate regression analysis, α' ≥ 39.5$\,^{\circ}$ was a strong predictor of MR recurrence, lack of LV reverse remodeling and lack of LV geometric reverse remodeling (all P values < .001). In contrast, the posterior mitral leaflet tethering angle, β', was not significant (all P values > .05). When we allowed for interactions between α' and other risk factors, this effect occurred also in low-risk subgroups, and it was equivalent or generally attenuated in higher risk patients. There were no significant interactions between α' and any of the covariates (all P values > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Anterior mitral leaflet tethering is a powerful predictor of MR recurrence and lack of LVRR after undersized mitral ring annuloplasty. Evaluation of leaflet tethering should be incorporated into clinical risk assessment and prediction models.},

	Abstract = {Restrictive mitral annuloplasty is a surgical treatment option for patients with heart failure (HF) and functional mitral regurgitation (MR). However, recurrent MR has been reported at mid-term follow-up. The aim of the present study was to identify the echocardiographic predictors of recurrent MR in patients with HF undergoing mitral annuloplasty. During a mean follow-up of 2.6 +/- 1.6 years, 109 patients with HF (49% ischemic and 51% idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy) who had undergone mitral valve repair were followed up (of 122 total patients). The severity of MR was quantified, and the following parameters were measured before intervention and at the mid-term follow-up examination: left ventricular (LV) and left atrial volumes and dimensions, LV sphericity index, mitral annular area, and mitral valve geometry parameters. At mid-term follow-up, 21 patients presented with significant MR (grade 2 to 4), and 88 patients had only MR grade 0 to 1. Both groups of patients had had a similar preoperative MR grade, mitral annular area, and LV volume and dimension. In contrast, patients with recurrent MR had had increased preoperative posterior and anterior leaflet angles, tenting height, tenting area, and LV sphericity index compared to the patients without recurrent MR. Of the different parameters of mitral and LV geometry, the distal mitral anterior leaflet angle (hazard ratio 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 1.66, p <0.001) and posterior leaflet angle (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.19, p <0.001) were independent determinants of MR at mid-term follow-up. In conclusion, in patients with HF of ischemic or idiopathic etiology and functional MR, distal mitral leaflet tethering and posterior mitral leaflet tethering were associated with recurrent MR after restrictive mitral annuloplasty.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is generally considered that patients with prior myocardial infarction (PMI) have worse outcomes than those without PMI after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, any difference in outcomes of patients with anterior or inferior PMI undergoing CABG has never been determined.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 310 patients with anterior or inferior PMI who underwent isolated CABG between September 2004 and September 2008. Of these, 151 patients had anterior PMI (anterior group), and 159 patients had inferior PMI (inferior group). Preoperative and postoperative variables were compared between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of major postoperative complications including death.
RESULTS: Patients of the inferior group were significantly older (68.3 +/- 9.2 vs 65.5 +/- 11.0; p = 0.015) and had more diseased vessels per patient (2.9 +/- 0.3 vs 2.8 +/- 0.5; p = 0.009) than the anterior group. A higher rate of mild or moderate mitral regurgitation was observed in the inferior group (18.2% vs 8.6%; p = 0.0209). The operative mortality was higher in the inferior group (5.0% vs 0%; p = 0.0073). Rates of respiratory failure (6.9% vs 0.7%; p = 0.0199) and requirement for hemodialysis (5.7% vs 0.7%; p = 0.0056) were higher in the inferior group. Multivariate analysis revealed inferior PMI (p = 0.0068) as the only independent predictor of major postoperative complications including death.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that patients with inferior PMI have poorer outcomes after isolated CABG than those with anterior PMI.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although mitral restrictive annuloplasty plus coronary artery bypass grafting are considered the best therapeutic strategies for ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation, some recurrences are still reported. We evaluated predictors for late recurrence of ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation.
METHODS: Hospital outcome and serial clinical and echocardiographic (preoperative, discharge, 6 months, end of follow-up) follow-up assessments were recorded for 82 consecutive patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation having coronary artery bypass grafting + mitral restrictive annuloplasty (2 sizes ring downsizing). Recurrent ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation was defined by grade >or= 2 at echocardiography.
RESULTS: Hospital mortality was 4.9%; 17.7 +/- 1.7 (standard error) months (range 1-55) survival was 95.5% +/- 2.5%. Two-year Kaplan-Meier freedom from reintervention was 94.2% +/- 4.2%; from rerevascularization, 87.5% +/- 11.7%; from congestive heart failure, 83.8% +/- 5.7%; from ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation grade >or= 2, 46.5% +/- 11.2%. Recurrence of ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation gave lower 2-year Kaplan-Meier freedom from death (P = .03) and lower 2-year freedom from congestive heart failure (P = .0001), reintervention (P = .034), and tricuspid insufficiency (P = .0001). Ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation recurrence correlated with worsened New York Heart Association class (P = .0001), left ventricular ejection fraction (P = .024), pulmonary arterial pressures (P = .0001), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (P = .004), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (P = .014), indexed left ventricular mass (P = .008), and coaptation depth (P = .0001). Independent predictors for recurrent ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation were previous anterior + posterior myocardial infarction (odds ratio 3.70; confidence interval 2.93-5.41; P = .001), preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic diameter >or= 70 mm (odds ratio 3.91; confidence interval 2.65-5.22; P = .001), and coaptation depth at discharge >or= 0.5 cm (odds ratio 11.9; confidence interval 5.91-21.34; P = .0001). Preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic diameter >or= 70 mm correlated with higher congestive heart failure (P = .002), recurrent ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation (P = .0001), worsened New York Heart Association class (P = .0001), and higher diuretics (P = .0001). Coaptation depth < 0.5 cm at discharge accounted for better survival (P = .010), lower incidence of congestive heart failure (P = .0001), lower need for diuretics (P = .0001), and improved New York Heart Association class (P = .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Failure of mitral restrictive annuloplasty is responsible for follow-up mortality and congestive heart failure and correlates with absence of cardiac reverse remodeling. Prognosis of patients having mitral restrictive annuloplasty for ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic mitral regurgitation is good, as long as a low postoperative coaptation depth is achieved. Patients with significant left ventricular dilation should be considered for different surgical strategies.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was aimed at exploring the predictive value of diastolic function on clinical outcome and recurrence of ischemic mitral regurgitation following combined undersized mitral annuloplasty (UMRA) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
METHODS: Two hundred-thirty-four patients with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation (CIMR) who survived combined UMRA and CABG between September 2001 and September 2007, were divided into four groups on the basis of baseline deceleration time (DT) and systolic-diastolic pulmonary venous flow ratio (S/D): Group 1, normal (n=48), Group 2, impaired relaxation (n=61), Group 3, pseudonormal (n=60) and Group 4, restrictive (n=65). Echocardiograms were performed, preoperatively, at discharge and at follow-up appointments (early, 6 months [interquartile range, IQR] 3-8 months; late, 38 months [IQR17-53 months]).
RESULTS: Early mortality rate was highest in the restrictive group (9.2%, p<0.001). In addition 6-year actuarial survival was significantly lower in Group 4 (p=0.025). At late follow-up, among patients in Group 4, 58.4% (n=38) had an MR grade >or=2 (p<0.001). Furthermore, DT<140 ms and S/D<0.80 were independent predictors of early (p<0.001 and 0.004, respectively) and late (both p<0.001) death. Finally DT<140 ms was the only diastolic independent predictor of MR recurrence (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CIMR undergoing combined CABG and UMRA restrictive LV diastolic filling pattern is an important preoperative marker of high early and late death and recurrence of MR.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated leaflet and subvalvular configurations to identify mechanisms leading to recurrent mitral regurgitation after combined undersized mitral annuloplasty and coronary artery bypass and to preoperatively recognize patients who are unlikely to benefit from this approach.
METHODS: Among 261 subjects with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation undergoing undersized annuloplasty and coronary bypass surgery at one institution between September 2001 and September 2007, 31 were excluded: 4 had intraoperative annuloplasty failure, 12 showed residual regurgitation, and 15 had incomplete echocardiograms available. The study population consisted of 230 patients who were divided into 2 groups: patients without (group 1, n = 176) or with (group 2, n = 54) late recurrent mitral regurgitation. Fifty healthy subjects were used as control subjects. Serial echocardiographic analysis was performed preoperatively, at discharge, and at follow-up appointments (early: median, 6 months [interquartile range, 5-6 months; late: median, 33 months [interquartile range, 17-51 months]).
RESULTS: Subjects with late regurgitation had preoperatively more symmetric tethering (P < .001), more accentuated anterior mitral leaflet tethering (P < .001), and more restricted anterior leaflet excursion (P = .003) than patients in group 1. Postoperatively, tethering of the posterior leaflet increased (P < .001) and was predominant in both groups, whereas tethering of the anterior leaflet was reduced at discharge (P = .01 and P = .03, respectively), remaining constant afterward. Multivariable analysis showed an anterior tethering angle of 39.5 degrees or greater (P < .001), an anterior/posterior tethering angle ratio of 0.76 or greater (P < .001), an anterior leaflet excursion angle of 35 degrees or less (P = .001), and a coaptation height of 11 mm or greater (P = .04) to be predictors of recurrent mitral regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative symmetric tethering with anterior mitral leaflet predominance was strongly associated with recurrence of mitral regurgitation. Measures of leaflet tethering resulted in fundamental findings to identify ischemic patients who can really benefit from restrictive annuloplasty. Further larger studies are necessary to confirm our results.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: We present 5-year echocardiographic results of combined undersizing mitral ring annuloplasty (UMRA) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in chronic ischaemic mitral regurgitation (CIMR).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-one patients (aged 68.4 +/- 8.1, 62.5% male) undergoing combined CABG and UMRA in our Institution (Cardiac Surgery, Careggi Hospital, Florence, Italy) between September 2001 and March 2007 were prospectively enrolled in the study. Median follow up was 32.9 months [interquartile range (IQR) 17.5-51.6]. Fourteen patients with significant residual mitral regurgitation (MR) needing immediate intraoperative revision (n = 3) or at discharge (n = 11) were excluded from the study. Serial echocardiograms were performed in 220 survivors at baseline, discharge, and annually thereafter. Additionally, 17 patients died (2 early and 15 late deaths) and were also excluded from the study. MR remained stable at 1 year and re-increased at 3 years (P < 0.001) and 5 years (P < 0.001). Five-year actuarial survival was 83.2 +/- 4.4. Five-year freedom from re-operation for failed repair was 78.2 +/- 4.9%. Mean systolic and diastolic diameters decreased significantly at discharge (P = 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively) and at early follow up (P = 0.004 and P = 0.02) but raised at 3 years (P < 0.001) and 5 years (P < 0.001). Systolic and diastolic sphericity indexes improved at discharge (P < 0.001) remained stable at 1 year but they re-increased at 3-year control (P = 0.006 and P = 0.03, respectively) with a late raise exceeding the pre-operative value (P < 0.001). Left ventricular reverse remodelling was observed in 44.2% of the study population with 10.3% of patients showing further left ventricular dilatation. At multivariable model, end-systolic volume > or =145 mL, systolic sphericity index > or =0.7, myocardial performance index > or =0.9, and wall motion score index > or =1.5 were predictors of recurrent MR.
CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the need for improved repair technique and better patient selection to identify patients with anticipated repair failure who could benefit more from valve replacement or other procedure directly addressing ventricular tethering.},

@article{ueno08,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The recurrence of ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) after mitral annuloplasty is a major determinant of patient survival. The study aim was to investigate, retrospectively, the characteristics of patients with postoperative recurrence of IMR.
METHODS: Twenty patients who had no regurgitation immediately after mitral annuloplasty, were allocated to either recurrence (n = 8) or non-recurrence (n = 12) groups. Recurrence was defined as any interval upgrade of regurgitation. The patients' preoperative profiles and parameters of preoperative, immediate postoperative and intermediate postoperative echocardiography were compared.
RESULTS: Patients with recurrence were more frequently dyspneic and had a significantly higher cardiothoracic ratio (p = 0.041) on radiologic examination. The preoperative left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions (p = 0.018 and 0.021), and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (p = 0.038 and 0.041), and left ventricular wall motion score (p = 0.0002) were significantly greater in the recurrence group. These differences in left ventricular volume persisted at the immediate and intermediate postoperative stages. Reverse remodeling occurred at a ca. 50% lower rate in the recurrence group, and was associated with significantly smaller preoperative left ventricular dimension and volume. At intermediate follow up, the left ventricular ejection fraction was improved and significantly greater in the non-recurrence group (p = 0.024), but remained unchanged in the recurrence group.
CONCLUSION: Advanced left ventricular remodeling and dilatation before surgery predispose to a recurrence of mitral regurgitation and a lesser incidence of reverse remodeling. Mitral annuloplasty alone may have a limited role in preventing the recurrence of regurgitation in the case of advanced IMR, without functional recovery.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) often persists after restrictive mitral valve annuloplasty, in which case it is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The goal of the present study was to determine whether persistence of MR and/or clinical outcome could be predicted from preoperative analysis of mitral valve configuration.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 51 consecutive patients undergoing restrictive annuloplasty for ischemic MR, posterior leaflet (PL) angle, anterior leaflet angle, coaptation distance, and tenting area were quantified by echocardiography before surgery (6+/-3 days), and MR severity was assessed before and early after surgery (9+/-4 days). Postoperatively, persistence of mild to moderate MR (vena contracta > 3 mm) was observed in 11 (22%) of the patients. The best predictor of postoperative persistence of MR was a PL angle > or = 45 degrees (sensitivity 100%, specificity 97%, positive predictive value 92%, negative predictive value 100%). Patients with persistent MR had markedly lower 3-year event-free survival (26+/-20%) compared with those with nonpersistent MR (75+/-12%, P=0.01). Preoperative presence of a PL angle > or = 45 degrees also was associated with a markedly lower 3-year event-free survival (22+/-17% versus 76+/-12%; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing restrictive annuloplasty for ischemic MR, persistence of MR and 3-year event-free survival can accurately be predicted by preoperative analysis of mitral valve configuration. Patients with a PL angle > or = 45 degrees (ie, with high PL restriction) should thus be considered poor candidates for this procedure, and concomitant or alternative procedures should be contemplated.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) is a complex lesion to repair, and its successful management requires an understanding of its mechanism and severity. Ring annuloplasty, currently the surgical treatment of choice for IMR, has failure rates as high as 30% in patients with functional IMR. We sought to study the variables that can predict IMR recurrence after ring annuloplasty.
METHODS: This is a prospective study of 114 patients with 3+ to 4+ IMR who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral valve annuloplasty with acceptable results at an approximately 2-year follow-up. Variables were compared in a failure group, comprising patients with 2+ or higher MR and a nonfailure group, consisting of those with less than +2 MR.
RESULTS: There were five postoperative in-hospital deaths. During follow-up, 14 patients died and 95 patients were evaluated. After a mean follow-up of 22.2 +/- 4.6 months for the nonfailure group and 18.6 +/- 5.6 months for the failure group, 23 patients (24.4%) exhibited annuloplasty failure. Some variables had an effect in our univariate analysis, but only interpapillary muscle distance had a relationship with recurrent MR in the multivariate analysis. Mean preoperative interpapillary muscle distance was 15.0 +/- 4.0 and 26.5 +/- 2.9 in the nonfailure group and failure group, respectively (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Interpapillary muscle distance, as a reliable index of dysfunctional subvalvular apparatus in patients with IMR, can predict late postrepair MR and indicate the need for a procedure complementary to annuloplasty.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation is associated with poor long-term survival. Despite the increasing popularity of valve repair, its durability and long-term outcome for ischemic mitral regurgitation have recently been questioned.
METHODS: Seventy-eight patients underwent repair for ischemic mitral regurgitation between 1996 and 2002 at our institution. Of these patients, 73 had complete clinical and echocardiographic follow-up. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative clinical data were obtained, and the results of echocardiograms were reviewed to assess the rate of recurrence of regurgitation after repair and to identify predictive factors.
RESULTS: The mean preoperative mitral regurgitation grade, New York Heart Association class, and left ventricular ejection fraction were 2.72, 2.65, and 39.4%, respectively. Mortality was 12.3% at 30 days and 30.1% at a mean follow-up of 39 +/- 25 months. Immediate postoperative echocardiography showed absent or mild mitral regurgitation in 89.4% of patients and showed moderate mitral regurgitation in 10.6%. Freedom from reoperation was 93.2%. Recurrent moderate mitral regurgitation (2+) was present in 36.7% of patients, and severe mitral regurgitation (3+ to 4+) was present in 20.0% at mean follow-up of 28.1 +/- 22.5 months. Only age (P = .0130) and less marked preoperative posterior tethering (P = .0362) were predictive of recurrent mitral regurgitation. Patients with a preoperative New York Heart Association class greater than II and recurrent mitral regurgitation greater than 2+ had decreased survival (P = .0152 and P = .0450, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Significant recurrent mitral regurgitation occurs following repair for ischemic mitral regurgitation, despite good early results. This finding raises questions about the need for improved repair techniques, better patient selection, or eventual mitral valve replacement in selected patients.},

	Abstract = {Mitral valve (MV) annuloplasty is the standard surgical technique for the management of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR). However, < or = 1/3 of patients develop recurrent MR after annuloplasty. Therefore, we sought to identify the preoperative echocardiographic parameters that predict annuloplasty failure in patients with ischemic MR. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiograms from 365 patients who underwent MV repair for ischemic MR were reviewed. Of the 365 patients, 297 (81%) had satisfactory outcomes with < 2+ MR, and 68 (19%) had recurrent MR (> or = 2+) during a mean follow-up of 269 days. The mitral annular parameters, including mitral annular diameter, tethering height, and tethering area of the mitral leaflets, were determined in 3 different echocardiographic views. On multiple logistic stepwise regression analysis, a higher mitral annular diameter, higher tethering area, and higher MR severity were identified as independent predictors for failure of MV repair (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, these results demonstrated that preoperative echocardiographic findings can be used to identify patients with ischemic MR at increased risk of repair failure. These echocardiographic measurements should be used to guide the cardiologist and cardiac surgeon in the choice of MV repair versus replacement in patients with ischemic MR.},

	Abstract = {AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling impairment on postoperative results in patients with low LV ejection fraction (EF) undergoing combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mitral valve (MV) repair.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Study population consisted of 53 patients with ischemic MV incompetence and LV systolic dysfunction (mean EF-26.1 +/- 6%), who underwent CABG with MV repair. Patients were divided into three groups according to the LV diastolic filling pattern. Study protocol included evaluation of perioperative mortality (30 days inhospital mortality), NYHA functional class, and two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic examination preoperatively, 10-14 days, and 12 months after surgery. The highest perioperative mortality rate (33.3%), unimproved functional status (in 78.5% of the patients, NYHA functional class remained unchanged late after surgery), and hemodynamic deterioration (LV dilatation, progression of mitral regurgitation (MR) was observed in the restriction group). Though early after surgery, MR reduction was significant in this group, at even one year after surgery 85.7% of patients presented with >grade 1 of MR (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that restrictive LV diastolic filling is an important independent preoperative marker (P = 0.035) of progression of MR late after MV repair.
CONCLUSION: In patients with severe LV dysfunction undergoing combined CABG and MV repair, restrictive LV diastolic filling pattern is an important preoperative marker of high perioperative mortality rate, further negative remodeling of LV, and progression of mitral regurgitation late after MV repair.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that surgical annuloplasty for ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) that displaces the posterior annulus anteriorly can potentially augment posterior leaflet (PML) tethering, leading to persistent MR. Relationships between leaflet configurations and persistent ischemic MR after the annuloplasty were investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 31 patients with surgical annuloplasty for ischemic MR and 20 controls, posterior and apical displacement of the leaflet coaptation, the anterior leaflet (AML) and PML tethering angles relative to the line connecting annuli, coaptation length (CL), and the MR grade were quantified before and early after surgery in echocardiographic left ventricular long-axis views. Six of the 31 patients showed persistent MR despite annuloplasty. Compared with patients without persistent MR, those with MR showed no improvement in the left ventricular ejection fraction and systolic volume, similar reduction in the annular area, significant increase in posterior displacement of the coaptation (P<0.01), no improvement in AML tethering, greater worsening in PML tethering (P<0.01), and no increase in the CL. All tethering variables were significantly correlated with both preoperative and postoperative MR in univariate analysis, and reduced CL was the primary independent determinant of both preoperative and postoperative MR. Although increased AML tethering was the primary determinant of the preoperative CL (r2=0.46, P<0.0001), increased PML tethering was the primary determinant afterward (r2=0.60, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although tethering of both leaflets is the major determinant of ischemic MR before surgical annuloplasty, both leaflets tethering but with predominant and augmented PML tethering is related to persistent ischemic MR after the annnuloplasty.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical annuloplasty can potentially hoist the posterior annulus anteriorly, exaggerate posterior leaflet (PML) tethering, and lead to recurrent ischemic/functional mitral regurgitation (MR). Characteristics of leaflet configurations in late postoperative MR were investigated.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 30 patients with surgical annuloplasty for ischemic MR and 20 controls, the anterior leaflet (AML) and PML tethering angles relative to the line connecting annuli, posterior and apical displacement of the coaptation and the MR grade were measured by echocardiography before, early after, and late after surgery. Early after surgery, grade of MR and AML tethering generally decreased (P<0.01), whereas PML tethering significantly worsened (P<0.01). Nine of the 30 patients showed recurrent/persistent MR late after surgery. Compared with patients without late MR, those with the MR showed similar reduction in the annular area, significant re-increase in posterior displacement of the coaptation, and progressive worsening in PML tethering (P<0.05) late after surgery in comparison to the early phase. Both preoperative MR and late postoperative MR were significantly correlated with all tethering variables in univariate analysis. Although apical displacement of the coaptation was the primary determinant of preoperative MR (r2=0.60, P<0.0001), increased PML tethering was the primary determinant of late MR (r2=0.75, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Whereas both leaflets tethering is related to preoperative ischemic MR, both leaflets tethering but with predominant contribution from augmented and progressive PML tethering is related to recurrent/persistent ischemic/functional MR late after surgical annuloplasty.},

@article{bouma10,
	Abstract = {Chronic ischaemic mitral regurgitation (CIMR) remains one of the most complex and unresolved aspects in the management of ischaemic heart disease. This review provides an overview of the present knowledge about the different aspects of CIMR with an emphasis on mechanisms, current surgical treatment results and new mechanism-based surgical approaches. CIMR occurs in approximately 20-25% of patients followed up after myocardial infarction (MI) and in 50% of those with post-infarct congestive heart failure (CHF). The presence of CIMR adversely affects prognosis, increasing mortality and the risk of CHF in a graded fashion according to CIMR severity. The primary mechanism of CIMR is ischaemia-induced left ventricular (LV) remodelling with papillary muscle displacement and apical tenting of the mitral valve leaflets. CIMR is often clinically silent, and colour-Doppler echocardiography remains the most reliable diagnostic tool. The most commonly performed surgical procedure for CIMR (restrictive annuloplasty combined with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)) can provide good results in selected patients with minimal LV dilatation and minimal tenting. However, in general the persistence and recurrence rate (at least MR grade 3+) for restrictive annuloplasty remains high (up to 30% at 6 months postoperatively), and after a 10-year follow-up there does not appear to be a survival benefit of a combined procedure compared to CABG alone (10-year survival rate for both is approximately 50%). Patients at risk of annuloplasty failure based on preoperative echocardiographic and clinical parameters may benefit from mitral valve replacement with preservation of the subvalvular apparatus or from new alternative procedures targeting the subvalvular apparatus including the LV. These new procedures include second-order chordal cutting, papillary muscle repositioning by a variety of techniques and ventricular approaches using external ventricular restraint devices or the Coapsys device. In addition, percutaneous transvenous repair techniques are being developed. Although promising, at this point these new procedures still lack investigation in large patient cohorts with long-term follow-up. They will, however, be the subject of much anticipated and necessary ongoing and future research.},

@article{matsunaga04,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The standard treatment for functional ischemic mitral regurgitation (FIMR) is revascularization and reduction annuloplasty. Although the immediate results are excellent, some patients develop recurrent mitral regurgitation (MR) at mid-term follow up. The study aim was to identify possible preoperative echocardiographic parameters that might predict the risk of recurrent FIMR.
METHODS: From 124 consecutive patients who underwent revascularization and ring annuloplasty, 48 were selected if they: (i) had a complete preoperative and follow up transthoracic echocardiogram; and (ii) left the operating room with grade 1+ MR. Those patients with moderate or greater late MR were classified as having significant recurrent FIMR (MR group), and those with mild or no MR were classified as no significant FIMR (No-MR group). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular (LV) sphericity, percentage MR jet area, mitral valve tenting area, mitral valve coaptation height, papillary muscle (PM) tethering distance, PM depth, and PM angle were measured by echocardiography preoperatively and at mid-term follow up.
RESULTS: No preoperative differences were found between groups except in posterior PM depth and PM angle. The posterior PM depth and angle in the MR group were significantly smaller than in the No-MR group. In the No-MR group, the posterior PM tethering distance decreased and the PM angle increased significantly with decreasing LV sphericity. In contrast, in the MR group, posterior PM tethering distance, PM depth, and PM angle were unchanged, and the anterior PM depth and PM angle decreased significantly with decreasing LVEF.
CONCLUSION: FIMR is primarily due to PM displacement, and posterior PM relocation is especially important. Ring annuloplasty does not protect against recurrent FIMR in patients with severe outward displacement of the posterior PM. The severity of posterior PM displacement might be a predictor of ring annuloplasty failure.},

The framework supports composite deformation models, controlled by parameters for contour shape in addition to global pose. Tracking is performed in a sequential state estimation fashion, using an extended Kalman filter, with measurement processing in information space to effectively predict and update contour deformations in real-time. A deformable B-spline surface coupled with a global pose transform is used to model shape changes of the left ventricle of the heart. Successful tracking of global motion and local shape changes without user intervention is demonstrated on a dataset consisting of 21 3D echocardiography recordings. Real-time tracking using the proposed approach requires a modest CPU load of 13% on a modern computer. The segmented volumes compare to a semi-automatic segmentation tool with 95% limits of agreement in the interval 4.1 +/- 24.6 ml (r = 0.92).},

	Abstract = {Ultrasound is a main noninvasive modality for the assessment of the heart function. Wall tracking from ultrasound data is, however, inherently difficult due to weak echoes, clutter, poor signal-to-noise ratio, and signal dropouts. To cope with these artifacts, pretrained shape models can be applied to constrain the tracking. However, existing methods for incorporating subspace shape constraints in myocardial border tracking use only partial information from the model distribution, and do not exploit spatially varying uncertainties from feature tracking. In this paper, we propose a complete fusion formulation in the information space for robust shape tracking, optimally resolving uncertainties from the system dynamics, heteroscedastic measurement noise, and subspace shape model. We also exploit information from the ground truth initialization where this is available. The new framework is applied for tracking of myocardial borders in very noisy echocardiography sequences. Numerous myocardium tracking experiments validate the theory and show the potential of very accurate wall motion measurements. The proposed framework outperforms the traditional shape-space-constrained tracking algorithm by a significant margin. Due to the optimal fusion of different sources of uncertainties, robust performance is observed even for the most challenging cases.},

The ASM was trained by tracing the left ventricle in 31 patients, and provided a compact and physiological realistic shape space. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was evaluated in 21 patients, and compared to manually verified segmentations from a custom-made semi-automatic segmentation algorithm. Successful segmentation was achieved in all cases. The limits of agreement (mean$\pm$1.96SD) for the point-to-surface distance were 2.2$\pm$1.1mm. For volumes, the correlation coefficient was 0.95 and the limits of agreement were 3.4$\pm$20 ml. Real-time segmentation of 25 frames per second was achieved with a CPU load of 22%.},

	Abstract = {We propose a novel framework for the automatic propagation of a set of manually labeled brain atlases to a diverse set of images of a population of subjects. A manifold is learned from a coordinate system embedding that allows the identification of neighborhoods which contain images that are similar based on a chosen criterion. Within the new coordinate system, the initial set of atlases is propagated to all images through a succession of multi-atlas segmentation steps. This breaks the problem of registering images that are very "dissimilar" down into a problem of registering a series of images that are "similar". At the same time, it allows the potentially large deformation between the images to be modeled as a sequence of several smaller deformations. We applied the proposed method to an exemplar region centered around the hippocampus from a set of 30 atlases based on images from young healthy subjects and a dataset of 796 images from elderly dementia patients and age-matched controls enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We demonstrate an increasing gain in accuracy of the new method, compared to standard multi-atlas segmentation, with increasing distance between the target image and the initial set of atlases in the coordinate embedding, i.e., with a greater difference between atlas and image. For the segmentation of the hippocampus on 182 images for which a manual segmentation is available, we achieved an average overlap (Dice coefficient) of 0.85 with the manual reference.},

	Abstract = {Since the early 1980s, a bewildering array of methods for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals have been proposed. In this article, we address the following questions. First, when should bootstrap confidence intervals be used. Secondly, which method should be chosen, and thirdly, how should it be implemented. In order to do this, we review the common algorithms for resampling and methods for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals, together with some less well known ones, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We then present a simulation study, a flow chart for choosing an appropriate method and a survival analysis example.},

	Abstract = {Among screening modalities, echocardiography is the fastest, least expensive and least invasive method for imaging the heart. A new generation of three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound (US) technology has been developed with real-time 3-D (RT3-D) matrix phased-array transducers. These transducers allow interactive 3-D visualization of cardiac anatomy and fast ventricular volume estimation without tomographic interpolation as required with earlier 3-D US acquisition systems. However, real-time acquisition speed is performed at the cost of decreasing spatial resolution, leading to echocardiographic data with poor definition of anatomical structures and high levels of speckle noise. The poor quality of the US signal has limited the acceptance of RT3-D US technology in clinical practice, despite the wealth of information acquired by this system, far greater than with any other existing echocardiography screening modality. We present, in this work, a clinical study for segmentation of right and left ventricular volumes using RT3-D US. A preprocessing of the volumetric data sets was performed using spatiotemporal brushlet denoising, as presented in previous articles Two deformable-model segmentation methods were implemented in 2-D using a parametric formulation and in 3-D using an implicit formulation with a level set implementation for extraction of endocardial surfaces on denoised RT3-D US data. A complete and rigorous validation of the segmentation methods was carried out for quantification of left and right ventricular volumes and ejection fraction, including comparison of measurements with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging as the reference. Results for volume and ejection fraction measurements report good performance of quantification of cardiac function on RT3-D data compared with magnetic resonance imaging with better performance of semiautomatic segmentation methods than with manual tracing on the US data.},

@article{corsi05,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Real-time 3D echocardiographic (RT3DE) data sets contain dynamic volumetric information on cardiac function. However, quantification of left ventricular (LV) function from 3D echocardiographic data is performed on cut-planes extracted from the 3D data sets and thus does not fully exploit the volumetric information. Accordingly, we developed a volumetric analysis technique aimed at quantification of global and regional LV function.
METHODS AND RESULTS: RT3DE images obtained in 30 patients (Philips 7500) were analyzed by use of custom software based on the level-set approach for semiautomated detection of LV endocardial surface throughout the cardiac cycle, from which global and regional LV volume (LVV)-time and wall motion (WM)-time curves were obtained. The study design included 3 protocols. In protocol 1, time curves obtained in 16 patients were compared point-by-point with MRI data (linear regression and Bland-Altman analyses). Global LVV correlated highly with MRI (r=0.98; y=0.99x+2.3) with minimal bias (1.4 mL) and narrow limits of agreement (+/-20 mL). WM correlated highly only in basal and midventricular segments (r=0.88; y=0.85x+0.7). In protocol 2, we tested the ability of this technique to differentiate populations with known differences in LV function by studying 9 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 9 normal subjects. All calculated indices of global and regional systolic and diastolic LV function were significantly different between the groups. In protocol 3, we tested the feasibility of automated detection of regional WM abnormalities in 11 patients. In each segment, abnormality was detected when regional shortening fraction was below a threshold obtained in normal subjects. The automated detection agreed with expert interpretation of 2D WM in 86% of segments.
CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric analysis of RT3DE data is clinically feasible and allows fast, semiautomated, dynamic measurement of LVV and automated detection of regional WM abnormalities.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative functional analysis of the left ventricle plays a very important role in the diagnosis of heart diseases. While in standard two-dimensional echocardiography this quantification is limited to rather crude volume estimation, three-dimensional (3-D) echocardiography not only significantly improves its accuracy but also makes it possible to derive valuable additional information, like various wall-motion measurements. In this paper, we present a new efficient method for the functional evaluation of the left ventricle from 3-D echographic sequences. It comprises a segmentation step that is based on the integration of 3-D deformable surfaces and a four-dimensional statistical heart motion model. The segmentation results in an accurate 3-D + time left ventricle discrete representation. Functional descriptors like local wall-motion indexes are automatically derived from this representation. The method has been successfully tested both on electrocardiography-gated and real-time 3-D data. It has proven to be fast, accurate, and robust.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Durability assessment of mitral valve repair for degenerative valve incompetence is limited to reoperation as a primary indicator and valve-related risk factors for late death as a secondary indicator. We assessed serial echocardiographic follow-up of valve function as an indicator of the durability of mitral valve repair.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 348 patients having undergone mitral valve repair for degenerative valve incompetence, clinical outcome was excellent: 10 years after repair, survival was 80.1% and freedom from reoperation 94.4%. However, freedom from mitral regurgitation (>2/4), 98.7% at 1 month, decreased to 82.2% at 5 years and 64.9% at 10 years. The linearized recurrence rate of mitral regurgitation (>2/4) was 3.2% per year. Recurrence rate was higher in patients with Barlow disease (6.0%) and lower in those with fibroelastic deficiency (2.6%) (P = .01). Performing chordal shortening, the nonuse of sliding plasty and the nonuse of an annuloplasty ring were determined to be factors predicting recurrence of mitral regurgitation. In reconstructions avoiding these risk factors, recurrence rate decreased to 2.4%. There was no difference between Barlow disease and fibroelastic deficiency: 2.9% versus 2.2% (P > .05). Recurrent regurgitation is characterized by leaflet prolapse, thickening, and calcification.
CONCLUSION: When optimal surgical techniques are used, the residual recurrence rate of mitral valve regurgitation remains between 2% and 3% per year and is related to progressive degeneration of the chordae and the leaflets. Long-term results of mitral valve repair in Barlow disease are essentially the same as in fibroelastic deficiency.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Durability assessment of mitral valve repair for degenerative valve incompetence is actually limited to reoperation as the primary indicator, with valve-related risk factors for late death as a secondary indicator. We assessed serial echocardiographic follow-up of valve function as an indicator of the durability of mitral valve repair.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 242 patients who had undergone mitral valve repair for degenerative valve incompetence, echocardiographic follow-up of valve function, rate of reoperation, survival, and clinical outcome was studied. At 8 years after repair, clinical outcome was excellent, survival was 90.9+/-3.2%, freedom from reoperation was 94.2+/-2.3%, and freedom from anticoagulation bleeding and thromboembolic events was 90.4+/-2.7%. However, freedom from non-trivial mitral regurgitation (>1/4) was 94.3+/-1.6% at 1 month, 58.6+/-4.9% at 5 years, and 27.2+/-8.6% at 7 years. Freedom from severe mitral regurgitation (>2/4) was 98.3+/-0.9% at 1 month, 82.8+/-3.8% at 5 years and 71.1+/-7.4% at 7 years. The linearized recurrence rate of non-trivial mitral regurgitation (>1/4) was 8.3% per year and of severe mitral regurgitation (>2/4) was 3.7% per year. Inadequate surgical techniques (chordal shortening, no use of annuloplasty ring or sliding plasty) could only partially explain recurrence of regurgitation. In selected patients who did not have these risk factors, linearized recurrence rates were 6.9% per year and 2.5% per year, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The durability of a successful mitral reconstruction for degenerative mitral valve disease is not constant, and this should be taken into account when asymptomatic patients are offered early mitral valve repair.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a randomized trial comparing mitral-valve repair with mitral-valve replacement in patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, we found no significant difference in the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI), survival, or adverse events at 1 year after surgery. However, patients in the repair group had significantly more recurrences of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. We now report the 2-year outcomes of this trial.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 251 patients to mitral-valve repair or replacement. Patients were followed for 2 years, and clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: Among surviving patients, the mean ($\pm$SD) 2-year LVESVI was 52.6$\pm$27.7 ml per square meter of body-surface area with mitral-valve repair and 60.6$\pm$39.0 ml per square meter with mitral-valve replacement (mean changes from baseline, -9.0 ml per square meter and -6.5 ml per square meter, respectively). Two-year mortality was 19.0% in the repair group and 23.2% in the replacement group (hazard ratio in the repair group, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.35; P=0.39). The rank-based assessment of LVESVI at 2 years (incorporating deaths) showed no significant between-group difference (z score=-1.32, P=0.19). The rate of recurrence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation over 2 years was higher in the repair group than in the replacement group (58.8% vs. 3.8%, P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in rates of serious adverse events and overall readmissions, but patients in the repair group had more serious adverse events related to heart failure (P=0.05) and cardiovascular readmissions (P=0.01). On the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, there was a trend toward greater improvement in the replacement group (P=0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing mitral-valve repair or replacement for severe ischemic mitral regurgitation, we observed no significant between-group difference in left ventricular reverse remodeling or survival at 2 years. Mitral regurgitation recurred more frequently in the repair group, resulting in more heart-failure-related adverse events and cardiovascular admissions.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ischemic mitral regurgitation is associated with a substantial risk of death. Practice guidelines recommend surgery for patients with a severe form of this condition but acknowledge that the supporting evidence for repair or replacement is limited.
METHODS: We randomly assigned 251 patients with severe ischemic mitral regurgitation to undergo either mitral-valve repair or chordal-sparing replacement in order to evaluate efficacy and safety. The primary end point was the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) at 12 months, as assessed with the use of a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in which deaths were categorized below the lowest LVESVI rank.
RESULTS: At 12 months, the mean LVESVI among surviving patients was 54.6$\pm$25.0 ml per square meter of body-surface area in the repair group and 60.7$\pm$31.5 ml per square meter in the replacement group (mean change from baseline, -6.6 and -6.8 ml per square meter, respectively). The rate of death was 14.3% in the repair group and 17.6% in the replacement group (hazard ratio with repair, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 1.47; P=0.45 by the log-rank test). There was no significant between-group difference in LVESVI after adjustment for death (z score, 1.33; P=0.18). The rate of moderate or severe recurrence of mitral regurgitation at 12 months was higher in the repair group than in the replacement group (32.6% vs. 2.3%, P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of a composite of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, in functional status, or in quality of life at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed no significant difference in left ventricular reverse remodeling or survival at 12 months between patients who underwent mitral-valve repair and those who underwent mitral-valve replacement. Replacement provided a more durable correction of mitral regurgitation, but there was no significant between-group difference in clinical outcomes.

Before surgery, patients with valve repair were less symptomatic than those with replacement (42% in New York Heart Association functional class I or II versus 24%, respectively; P = .001), had less atrial fibrillation (41% versus 53%; P = .017), and had a better ejection fraction (63 +/- 9% versus 60 +/- 12%, P = .016). After valve repair, compared with valve replacement, overall survival at 10 years was 68 +/- 6% versus 52 +/- 4% (P = .0004), overall operative mortality was 2.6% versus 10.3% (P = .002), operative mortality in patients under age 75 was 1.3% versus 5.7% (P = .036), and late survival (in operative survivors) at 10 years was 69 +/- 6% versus 58 +/- 5% (P = .018). Late survival after valve repair was not different from expected survival. After surgery, ejection fraction decreased significantly in both groups but was higher after valve repair (P = .001). Multivariate analysis indicated an independent beneficial effect of valve repair on overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.39; P = .00001), operative mortality (odds ratio, 0.27; P = .026), late survival (hazard ratio, 0.44; P = .001), and postoperative ejection fraction (P = .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Valve repair significantly improves postoperative outcome in patients with mitral regurgitation and should be the preferred mode of surgical correction. The low operative mortality is an incentive for early surgery before ventricular dysfunction occurs.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In some respects, outcome reporting in valvular surgery has been hampered by focusing on specific populations, reluctance to publish high-risk subgroups, and possibly skewed or inadequate samples. The goal of this study was to evaluate risk factors for operative mortality comprehensively across the entire spectrum of cardiac valvular procedures over the past decade.
METHODS: All 409,904 valve procedures in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database performed between 1994 and 2003 were assessed, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons preoperative and operative variables were related to operative mortality by using a multivariable logistic regression model. Data were greater than 95% complete, and the relative importance of relevant risk factors was determined by ranking odds ratios. The analysis had a high predictive power, with a C statistic of 0.735.
RESULTS: In the model, 19 variables independently influenced operative mortality (all P < .01). The most significant was nonelective (acute) presentation (odds ratios, 2.11), followed by advanced age (odds ratios, 1.88), reoperation (odds ratios, 1.61), endocarditis (odds ratios, 1.59), and coronary disease (odds ratios, 1.58). Generally, valve replacement was associated with higher mortality than repair (odds ratios, 1.52). Overall, female gender was very important (odds ratios, 1.37), and earlier year of operation increased risk (odds ratios, 1.34), implying improving outcomes over time. Although any single comorbidity, on average, was only moderately contributory (odds ratios, 1.19), specific comorbidities, such as renal failure, or multiple comorbidities in a given patient could be very significant. Aortic root reconstruction carried the highest risk (odds ratios, 2.78), followed by tricuspid valve surgery (odds ratios, 2.26), multiple valve procedures (odds ratios, 2.06), and then isolated mitral (odds ratios, 1.47), pulmonic (odds ratios, 1.29), and aortic (reference procedure) operations. Reduced ejection fraction and severity of valve lesion were relatively less important (odds ratios, 1.34 and 0.83, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate the significance of acute presentation in determining operative risk, and earlier surgical intervention under elective conditions might be emphasized for all types of significant valve lesions. Because aortic root reconstruction doubles mortality compared with simple aortic valve procedures, root replacement should be reserved for specific root pathology. Finally, issues related to reoperation, endocarditis, valve repair, gender, and the various procedures deserve more detailed examination.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We compared mitral repair to replacement in patients with chronic ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), due to left ventricular dysfunction (LV-IMR) or papillary muscle infarction (PM-IMR).
METHODS: Patients with IMR undergoing repair (n = 65) or replacement (n = 137) from 1990 to 2001 were evaluated. There were 87 patients with LV-IMR, and 115 patients with PM-IMR. Patients presenting in cardiogenic shock were excluded. Outcomes were evaluated by Cox survival analysis with propensity score adjustment and bootstrap validation.
RESULTS: Survival at 3, 5, and 9 years was, respectively, 0.94, 0.79, and 0.63 in the repair group, and 0.73, 0.67, and 0.59 in the replacement group. The hazard ratio (HR) of death for mitral repair versus replacement was not constant over the period of follow-up. Repair was associated with better early survival in the PM-IMR group, with an adjusted HR of 0.25 (95% confidence interval: 0.09 to 0.71) at 1 year. In the LV-IMR group and in patients with PM-IMR with high acuity and comorbidity, there was no significant survival advantage associated with repair. The beneficial effect of repair was not evident at late follow-up in either group. These findings were independent of the surgeon. Need for reoperation was more common after repair than after replacement (14% versus 3%, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PM-IMR benefit from mitral repair with a significantly better early survival. However, the benefit of repair is not evident at longer follow-up. There was a nonsignificant trend toward greater early survival among patients with LV-IMR who underwent repair.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the outcomes of mitral repair and replacement in revascularized patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Combined coronary bypass (CABG) and mitral procedures have been associated with the highest mortality (>10%) in cardiac surgery. Recent studies have suggested that mitral valve replacement (MVR) with sparing of the subvalvular apparatus had comparable results to mitral repair when associated with CABG.
METHODS: Over the past 7 years, 54 patients had CABG/mitral repair versus 56 who had CABG/MVR with preservation of the subvalvular apparatus. The groups were similar in age at 69.2 years in the replacement group versus 67.0 in the repair group. We compared these 2 groups based on hospital mortality, incidence of complications including nosocomial infection, neurologic decompensation (stroke), pulmonary complication (pneumonia, atelectasis, and prolonged ventilation), and renal complications (acute renal failure or insufficiency).
RESULTS: The mitral repair group had a hospital mortality of 1.9% versus 10.7% in the replacement group (P = 0.05). Infection occurred in 9% of repairs compared with 13% of replacements (P = 0.59). The incidence of stroke was no different between groups (2 of 54 repairs vs. 2 of 56 replacements, P = 1.00). Pulmonary complication rate was 39% in repairs versus 32% in replacements (P = 0.59). Worsening renal function occurred in 15% of repairs versus 18% of replacements (P = 0.67).
CONCLUSIONS: Mitral repair is superior to mitral replacement when associated with coronary artery disease in terms of perioperative morbidity and hospital mortality. Although preservation of the subvalvular apparatus with MVR has a theoretical advantage in terms of ventricular function, mitral repair clearly adds a survival benefit in patients with concomitant ischemic cardiac disease.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) can directly cause ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), which has been touted as an indicator of poor prognosis in acute and early phases after MI. However, in the chronic post-MI phase, prognostic implications of IMR presence and degree are poorly defined.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 303 patients with previous (>16 days) Q-wave MI by ECG who underwent transthoracic echocardiography: 194 with IMR quantitatively assessed in routine practice and 109 without IMR matched for baseline age (71+/-11 versus 70+/-9 years, P=0.20), sex, and ejection fraction (EF, 33+/-14% versus 34+/-11%, P=0.14). In IMR patients, regurgitant volume (RVol) and effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) area were 36+/-24 mL/beat and 21+/-12 mm(2), respectively. After 5 years, total mortality and cardiac mortality for patients with IMR (62+/-5% and 50+/-6%, respectively) were higher than for those without IMR (39+/-6% and 30+/-5%, respectively) (both P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, independently of all baseline characteristics, particularly age and EF, the adjusted relative risks of total and cardiac mortality associated with the presence of IMR (1.88, P=0.003 and 1.83, P=0.014, respectively) and quantified degree of IMR defined by RVol >/=30 mL (2.05, P=0.002 and 2.01, P=0.009) and by ERO >/=20 mm(2) (2.23, P=0.003 and 2.38, P=0.004) were high.
CONCLUSIONS: In the chronic phase after MI, IMR presence is associated with excess mortality independently of baseline characteristics and degree of ventricular dysfunction. The mortality risk is related directly to the degree of IMR as defined by ERO and RVol. Therefore, IMR detection and quantification provide major information for risk stratification and clinical decision making in the chronic post-MI phase.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) may complicate acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, it is not known whether mild MR is an independent predictor of post-MI outcome.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 727 Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Study patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, including left ventriculography, up to 16 days after MI. Left ventriculograms were analyzed for diastolic and systolic volumes, global left ventricular sphericity, extent of wall motion abnormality, and endocardial curvature. The presence of MR was related to the risk of developing a cardiovascular event during 3.5 years of follow-up. MR was present in 141 patients (19.4%). Severe (3+) MR was present in only 2 patients. Patients with MR were more likely to have a persistently occluded infarct artery (MR versus no MR, 27.3% versus 15.2%; P=.001). Although the ejection fractions were similar, MR patients had larger end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes and more spherical ventricles than patients without MR. Sphericity change from diastole to systole was also significantly reduced in MR patients. Patients with MR were more likely to experience cardiovascular mortality (29% versus 12%; P<.001), severe heart failure (24% versus 16%; P=.0153), and the combined end point of cardiovascular mortality, severe heart failure, or recurrent myocardial infarction (47% versus 29%; P<.001). The presence of MR was an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild MR is an independent predictor of post-MI mortality. As such, it adds important information for risk stratification of post-MI patients.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The basis of mitral annuloplasty ring design has progressed from qualitative surgical intuition to experimental and theoretical analysis of annular geometry with quantitative imaging techniques. In this work, we present an automated three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic image analysis method that can be used to statistically assess variability in normal mitral annular geometry to support advancement in annuloplasty ring design.
METHODS: Three-dimensional patient-specific models of the mitral annulus were automatically generated from 3D echocardiographic images acquired from subjects with normal mitral valve structure and function. Geometric annular measurements including annular circumference, annular height, septolateral diameter, intercommissural width, and the annular height to intercommissural width ratio were automatically calculated. A mean 3D annular contour was computed, and principal component analysis was used to evaluate variability in normal annular shape.
RESULTS: The following mean $\pm$ standard deviations were obtained from 3D echocardiographic image analysis: annular circumference, 107.0 $\pm$ 14.6 mm; annular height, 7.6 $\pm$ 2.8 mm; septolateral diameter, 28.5 $\pm$ 3.7 mm; intercommissural width, 33.0 $\pm$ 5.3 mm; and annular height to intercommissural width ratio, 22.7% $\pm$ 6.9%. Principal component analysis indicated that shape variability was primarily related to overall annular size, with more subtle variation in the skewness and height of the anterior annular peak, independent of annular diameter.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific 3D echocardiographic-based modeling of the human mitral valve enables statistical analysis of physiologically normal mitral annular geometry. The tool can potentially lead to the development of a new generation of annuloplasty rings that restore the diseased mitral valve annulus back to a truly normal geometry.},

	Abstract = {Deformable modeling with medial axis representation is a useful means of segmenting and parametrically describing the shape of anatomical structures in medical images. Continuous medial representation (cm-rep) is a "skeleton-first" approach to deformable medial modeling that explicitly parameterizes an object's medial axis and derives the object's boundary algorithmically. Although cm-rep has effectively been used to segment and model a number of anatomical structures with non-branching medial topologies, the framework is challenging to apply to objects with branching medial geometries since branch curves in the medial axis are difficult to parameterize. In this work, we demonstrate the first clinical application of a new "boundary-first" deformable medial modeling paradigm, wherein an object's boundary is explicitly described and constraints are imposed on boundary geometry to preserve the branching configuration of the medial axis during model deformation. This "boundary-first" framework is leveraged to segment and morphologically analyze the aortic valve apparatus in 3D echocardiographic images. Relative to manual tracing, segmentation with deformable medial modeling achieves a mean boundary error of 0.41 $\pm$ 0.10 mm (approximately one voxel) in 22 3DE images of normal aortic valves at systole. Deformable medial modeling is additionally demonstrated on pathological cases, including aortic stenosis, Marfan syndrome, and bicuspid aortic valve disease. This study demonstrates a promising approach for quantitative 3DE analysis of aortic valve morphology.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new approach for statistical shape analysis of 3D anatomical objects based on features extracted from skeletons. Like prior work on medial representations, the approach involves deforming a template to target shapes in a way that preserves the branching structure of the skeleton and provides intersubject correspondence. However, unlike medial representations, which parameterize the skeleton surfaces explicitly, our representation is boundary-centric, and the skeleton is implicit. Similar to prior constrained modeling methods developed 2D objects or tube-like 3D objects, we impose symmetry constraints on tuples of boundary points in a way that guarantees the preservation of the skeleton's topology under deformation. Once discretized, the problem of deforming a template to a target shape is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem. The new technique is evaluated in terms of its ability to capture the shape of the corpus callosum tract extracted from diffusion-weighted MRI.},

(2006), is becoming one of the most widely-used and successful image segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. By manipulating and utilizing the entire dataset of "atlases" (training images that have been previously labeled, e.g., manually by an expert), rather than some model-based average representation, MAS has the flexibility to better capture anatomical variation, thus offering superior segmentation accuracy. This benefit, however, typically comes at a high computational cost. Recent advancements in computer hardware and image processing software have been instrumental in addressing this challenge and facilitated the wide adoption of MAS. Today, MAS has come a long way and the approach includes a wide array of sophisticated algorithms that employ ideas from machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization, and computer vision, among other fields. This paper presents a survey of published MAS algorithms and studies that have applied these methods to various biomedical problems. In writing this survey, we have three distinct aims. Our primary goal is to document how MAS was originally conceived, later evolved, and now relates to alternative methods. Second, this paper is intended to be a detailed reference of past research activity in MAS, which now spans over a decade (2003-2014) and entails novel methodological developments and application-specific solutions. Finally, our goal is to also present a perspective on the future of MAS, which, we believe, will be one of the dominant approaches in biomedical image segmentation.},

@article{dietterich98,
	Abstract = {This article reviews five approximate statistical tests for determining whether one learning algorithm outperforms another on a particular learning task. These tests are compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type I error). Two widely used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of type I error in certain situations and should never be used: a test for difference of two proportions and a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train-test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5 x 2 cv, based on five iterations of twofold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable type I error. The article also measures the power (ability to detect algorithm differences when they do exist) of these tests. The cross-validated t test is the most powerful. The 5 x 2 cv test is shown to be slightly more powerful than McNemar's test. The choice of the best test is determined by the computational cost of running the learning algorithm. For algorithms that can be executed only once, McNemar's test is the only test with acceptable type I error. For algorithms that can be executed 10 times, the 5 x 2 cv test is recommended, because it is slightly more powerful and because it directly measures variation due to the choice of training set.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Valve repair for ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR) with undersized annuloplasty rings is characterized by high IMR recurrence rates. Patient-specific preoperative imaging-based risk stratification for recurrent IMR would optimize results. We sought to determine if prerepair three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography combined with a novel valve-modeling algorithm would be predictive of IMR recurrence 6 months after repair.
METHODS: Intraoperative transesophageal real-time 3D echocardiography was performed in 50 patients undergoing undersized ring annuloplasty for IMR and in 21 patients with normal mitral valves. A customized image analysis protocol was used to assess 3D annular geometry and regional leaflet tethering. IMR recurrence (≥ grade 2) was assessed with two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography 6 months after repair.
RESULTS: Preoperative annular geometry was similar in all IMR patients, and preoperative leaflet tethering was significantly higher in patients with recurrent IMR (n=13) than in patients in whom IMR did not recur (n=37) (tethering index: 3.91 $\pm$ 1.01 vs 2.90 $\pm$ 1.17, p = 0.008; tethering angles of A3: 23.5$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 8.9$\,^{\circ}$ vs 14.4$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 11.4$\,^{\circ}$, p = 0.012; P2: 44.4$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 8.8$\,^{\circ}$ vs 28.2$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 17.0$\,^{\circ}$, p = 0.002; and P3: 35.2$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 6.0$\,^{\circ}$ vs. 18.6$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 12.7$\,^{\circ}$, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the preoperative P3 tethering angle as an independent predictor of IMR recurrence with an optimal cutoff value of 29.9$\,^{\circ}$ (area under the curve, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.00; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: 3D echocardiography combined with valve modeling is predictive of recurrent IMR. Preoperative regional leaflet tethering of segment P3 is a strong independent predictor of IMR recurrence after undersized ring annuloplasty. In patients with a preoperative P3 tethering angle of 29.9$\,^{\circ}$ or larger, chordal-sparing valve replacement rather than valve repair should be strongly considered.},

@article{hung04,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo ring annuloplasty for ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) often have persistent or recurrent MR. This may relate to persistent leaflet tethering from left ventricle (LV) dilatation that is not relieved by ring annuloplasty. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that recurrent MR in patients after ring annuloplasty relates to continued LV remodeling.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial echoes were reviewed in 30 patients (aged 72+/-11 years) who showed recurrent MR late (47+/-27 months) versus early (3.8+/-5.8 months) after ring annuloplasty for ischemic MR during coronary artery bypass grafting without interval infarction. Patients with intrinsic mitral valve disease were excluded. Echocardiographic measures of MR (vena contracta and jet area/left atrial area) and LV remodeling (LV dimensions, volumes, and sphericity) were assessed at each stage. The degree of MR increased from mild to moderate, on average, from early to late postoperative stages, without significant change in LV ejection fraction. Changes in MR paralleled increases in LV volumes and sphericity index at end-systole and end-diastole. The only independent predictor of late postoperative MR was LV sphericity index at end-systole.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent MR late after ring annuloplasty is associated with continued LV remodeling, emphasizing its dynamic relation to the LV.},

@article{mcgee04,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the temporal return of mitral regurgitation after annuloplasty for functional ischemic mitral regurgitation; to identify its predictors, particularly with respect to annuloplasty type; and to determine whether annuloplasty type influences survival.
METHODS: From April 1985 through November 2002, 585 patients underwent annuloplasty alone for repair of functional ischemic mitral regurgitation, generally with concomitant coronary revascularization (95%). A flexible band (Cosgrove) was used in 68%, a rigid ring (Carpentier) in 21%, and bovine pericardial annuloplasty (Peri-Guard) in 11%. Six hundred seventy-eight postoperative echocardiograms were available in 422 patients to assess the time course of postoperative mitral regurgitation and its correlates. Most echocardiograms were performed early after the operation (median, 8 days); 17% were performed at 1 year or beyond.
RESULTS: During the first 6 months after repair, the proportion of patients with 0 or 1+ mitral regurgitation decreased from 71% to 41%, whereas the proportion with 3+ or 4+ regurgitation increased from 13% to 28% ( P < .0001); the regurgitation grade was stable thereafter. The temporal pattern of development of 3+ or 4+ regurgitation was similar for Cosgrove bands and Carpentier rings (25%) but substantially worse for Peri-Guard annuloplasties (66%). Small annuloplasty size did not influence postoperative regurgitation grade ( P = .2), although Cosgrove bands were used in most patients receiving 26- and 28-mm annuloplasties. Freedom from reoperation was 97% at 5 years. Annuloplasty type was not associated with survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Although initial mitral valve replacement would eliminate the risk of postoperative mitral regurgitation, this strategy has been associated with reduced survival. Therefore the development of additional techniques is necessary to achieve more secure repair of functional ischemic mitral regurgitation.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study reviews the 223 consecutive mitral valve operations for ischemic mitral insufficiency performed at New York University Medical Center between January 1976 and January 1996. The results for mitral valve reconstruction are compared with those for prosthetic mitral valve replacement.
METHODS: From January 1976 to January 1996, 223 patients with ischemic mitral insufficiency underwent mitral valve reconstruction (n = 152) or prosthetic mitral valve replacement (n = 71). Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 89% of cases of mitral reconstruction and 80% of cases of prosthetic replacement. In the group undergoing reconstruction, 77% had valvuloplasty with a ring annuloplasty and 23% had valvuloplasty with suture annuloplasty. In the group undergoing prosthetic replacement, 82% of patients received bioprostheses and 18% received mechanical prostheses.
RESULTS: Follow-up was 93% complete (median 14.6 mo, range 0-219 mo). Thirty-day mortality was 10% for mitral reconstruction and 20% for prosthetic replacement. The short-term mortality was higher among patients in New York Heart Association functional class IV than among those in classes I to III (odds ratio 5.75, confidence interval 1.25-26.5) and was reduced among patients with angina relative to those without angina (odds ratio 0.26, confidence interval 0.05-1.2). The 30-day death or complication rate was similarly elevated among patients in functional class IV (odds ratio 5.53; confidence interval 1.23-25.04). Patients with mitral valve reconstruction had lower short-term complication or death rates than did patients with prosthetic valve replacement (odds ratio 0.43, confidence interval 0.20-0.90). Eighty-two percent of patients with mitral valve reconstruction had no insufficiency or only trace insufficiency during the long-term follow-up period. Five-year complication-free survivals were 64% (confidence interval 54%-74%) for patients undergoing mitral valve reconstruction and 47% (confidence interval 33%-60%) for patients undergoing prosthetic valve replacement. Results of a series of statistical analyses suggest that outcome was linked primarily to preoperative New York Heart Association functional class.
CONCLUSIONS: Initial mortalities were similar among patients undergoing prosthetic replacement and valve reconstruction. Poor outcome was primarily related to preexisting comorbidities. Patients undergoing valve reconstruction had fewer valve-related complications. Valve reconstruction resulted in excellent durability and freedom from complications. These findings suggest that mitral valve reconstruction should be considered for appropriate patients with ischemic mitral insufficiency.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to compare mitral valve repair and replacement as treatments for ischemic mitral regurgitation.
METHODS: From 1985 through 1997, a total of 482 patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation underwent either valve repair (n = 397) or valve replacement (n = 85). Patients more likely (P < or =.01) to undergo repair had functional mitral regurgitation or coronary revascularization with an internal thoracic artery graft; those more likely to receive valve replacement were in higher New York Heart Association functional classes or underwent emergency operations. These factors were used for multivariable propensity matching. Risk factors for early and late death were identified by multivariable, multiphase hazard function analysis.
RESULTS: Within the propensity-matched better-risk group, survivals after valve replacement were 81%, 56%, and 36% at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years, but survivals after repair were 94%, 82%, and 58% at these intervals (P =.08). In contrast, within the poor-risk group, survivals after repair and replacement were similar (P =.4). Risk factors (P < or =.01) included older age, higher functional class, greater wall motion abnormality, and renal dysfunction. Approximately 70% of patients were predicted to benefit from repair; the benefit lessened or was negated if an internal thoracic artery graft was not used, if a lateral wall motion abnormality was present, or if the mitral regurgitation jet pattern was complex. Freedom from repair failure at 5 years was 91%.
CONCLUSION: Late survival is poor after surgery for ischemic mitral regurgitation. Most patients with ischemic mitral regurgitation benefit from mitral valve repair. In the most complex, high-risk settings, survivals after repair and replacement are similar.},

	Abstract = {Predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with some symptoms of cognitive decline may have great influence on treatment choice and disease progression. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential of revealing early signs of neurodegeneration in the human brain and may thus aid in predicting and diagnosing AD. Surface-based cortical thickness measurements from T1-weighted MRI have demonstrated high sensitivity to cortical gray matter changes. In this study we investigated the possibility for using patterns of cortical thickness measurements for predicting AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We used a novel technique for identifying cortical regions potentially discriminative for separating individuals with MCI who progress to probable AD, from individuals with MCI who do not progress to probable AD. Specific patterns of atrophy were identified at four time periods before diagnosis of probable AD and features were selected as regions of interest within these patterns. The selected regions were used for cortical thickness measurements and applied in a classifier for testing the ability to predict AD at the four stages. In the validation, the test subjects were excluded from the feature selection to obtain unbiased results. The accuracy of the prediction improved as the time to conversion from MCI to AD decreased, from 70% at 3 years before the clinical criteria for AD was met, to 76% at 6 months before AD. By inclusion of test subjects in the feature selection process, the prediction accuracies were artificially inflated to a range of 73% to 81%. Two important results emerge from this study. First, prediction accuracies of conversion from MCI to AD can be improved by learning the atrophy patterns that are specific to the different stages of disease progression. This has the potential to guide the further development of imaging biomarkers in AD. Second, the results show that one needs to be careful when designing training, testing and validation schemes to ensure that datasets used to build the predictive models are not used in testing and validation.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns were examined together with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in serial scans of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The SPARE-AD score, summarizing brain atrophy patterns, was tested as a predictor of short-term conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI individuals that converted to AD (MCI-C) had mostly positive baseline SPARE-AD (Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of Early AD) and atrophy in temporal lobe gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), posterior cingulate/precuneous, and insula. MCI individuals that converted to AD had mostly AD-like baseline CSF biomarkers. MCI nonconverters (MCI-NC) had mixed baseline SPARE-AD and CSF values, suggesting that some MCI-NC subjects may later convert. Those MCI-NC with most negative baseline SPARE-AD scores (normal brain structure) had significantly higher baseline Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (28.67) than others, and relatively low annual rate of Mini Mental State Examination decrease (-0.25). MCI-NC with midlevel baseline SPARE-AD displayed faster annual rates of SPARE-AD increase (indicating progressing atrophy). SPARE-AD and CSF combination improved prediction over individual values. In summary, both SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers showed high baseline sensitivity, however, many MCI-NC had abnormal baseline SPARE-AD and CSF biomarkers. Longer follow-up will elucidate the specificity of baseline measurements.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a new single image acquisition super-resolution method is proposed to increase image resolution of diffusion weighted (DW) images. Based on a nonlocal patch-based strategy, the proposed method uses a non-diffusion image (b0) to constrain the reconstruction of DW images. An extensive validation is presented with a gold standard built on averaging 10 high-resolution DW acquisitions. A comparison with classical interpolation methods such as trilinear and B-spline demonstrates the competitive results of our proposed approach in terms of improvements on image reconstruction, fractional anisotropy (FA) estimation, generalized FA and angular reconstruction for tensor and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) models. Besides, first results of reconstructed ultra high resolution DW images are presented at 0.6×0.6×0.6 mm3 and 0.4×0.4×0.4 mm3 using our gold standard based on the average of 10 acquisitions, and on a single acquisition. Finally, fiber tracking results show the potential of the proposed super-resolution approach to accurately analyze white matter brain architecture.},

	Abstract = {Clinical annotations, such as voxel-wise binary or probabilistic tissue segmentations, structural parcellations, pathological regions-of-interest and anatomical landmarks are key to many clinical studies. However, due to the time consuming nature of manually generating these annotations, they tend to be scarce and limited to small subsets of data. This work explores a novel framework to propagate voxel-wise annotations between morphologically dissimilar images by diffusing and mapping the available examples through intermediate steps. A spatially-variant graph structure connecting morphologically similar subjects is introduced over a database of images, enabling the gradual diffusion of information to all the subjects, even in the presence of large-scale morphological variability. We illustrate the utility of the proposed framework on two example applications: brain parcellation using categorical labels and tissue segmentation using probabilistic features. The application of the proposed method to categorical label fusion showed highly statistically significant improvements when compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. Significant improvements were also observed when applying the proposed framework to probabilistic tissue segmentation of both synthetic and real data, mainly in the presence of large morphological variability.},

	Abstract = {The Alzheimer research community is actively pursuing novel biomarker and other biologic measures to characterize disease progression or to use as outcome measures in clinical trials. One product of these efforts has been a large literature reporting power calculations and estimates of sample size for planning future clinical trials and cohort studies with longitudinal rate of change outcome measures. Sample size estimates reported in this literature vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, including the statistical methods and model assumptions used in their calculation. We review this literature and suggest standards for reporting power calculation results. Regardless of the statistical methods used, studies consistently find that volumetric neuroimaging measures of regions of interest, such as hippocampal volume, outperform global cognitive scales traditionally used in clinical treatment trials in terms of the number of subjects required to detect a fixed percentage slowing of the rate of change observed in demented and cognitively impaired populations. However, statistical methods, model assumptions, and parameter estimates used in power calculations are often not reported in sufficient detail to be of maximum utility. We review the factors that influence sample size estimates, and discuss outstanding issues relevant to planning longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {Automated analysis of MRI data of the subregions of the hippocampus requires computational atlases built at a higher resolution than those that are typically used in current neuroimaging studies. Here we describe the construction of a statistical atlas of the hippocampal formation at the subregion level using ultra-high resolution, ex vivo MRI. Fifteen autopsy samples were scanned at 0.13 mm isotropic resolution (on average) using customized hardware. The images were manually segmented into 13 different hippocampal substructures using a protocol specifically designed for this study; precise delineations were made possible by the extraordinary resolution of the scans. In addition to the subregions, manual annotations for neighboring structures (e.g., amygdala, cortex) were obtained from a separate dataset of in vivo, T1-weighted MRI scans of the whole brain (1mm resolution). The manual labels from the in vivo and ex vivo data were combined into a single computational atlas of the hippocampal formation with a novel atlas building algorithm based on Bayesian inference. The resulting atlas can be used to automatically segment the hippocampal subregions in structural MRI images, using an algorithm that can analyze multimodal data and adapt to variations in MRI contrast due to differences in acquisition hardware or pulse sequences. The applicability of the atlas, which we are releasing as part of FreeSurfer (version 6.0), is demonstrated with experiments on three different publicly available datasets with different types of MRI contrast. The results show that the atlas and companion segmentation method: 1) can segment T1 and T2 images, as well as their combination, 2) replicate findings on mild cognitive impairment based on high-resolution T2 data, and 3) can discriminate between Alzheimer's disease subjects and elderly controls with 88% accuracy in standard resolution (1mm) T1 data, significantly outperforming the atlas in FreeSurfer version 5.3 (86% accuracy) and classification based on whole hippocampal volume (82% accuracy).},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: (18)F-florbetaben and positron emission tomography were used to examine the relationships between β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, cognition, hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensities in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: Forty-five MCI participants were evaluated. A neocortical standardized uptake value ratio threshold ≥ 1.45 was used to discriminate high from low Aβ burden. Correlations were adjusted for age, gender and years of education.
RESULTS: High Aβ burden was found in 53% of MCI. Regression analyses showed standardized uptake value ratio (r = -0.51, P = 0.0015) and hippocampal volume (r = 0.60, P = 0.024) both contributing to episodic memory impairment in independent fashion. White matter hyperintensities correlated with nonmemory cognition, and this correlation was particularly associated with Aβ burden.
CONCLUSION: Higher Aβ deposition in MCI is associated with more severe memory impairment and is contributing to early amnestic symptoms independent of hippocampal atrophy.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We assessed the clinical utility of β-amyloid (Aβ) imaging with (18)F-florbetaben (FBB) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by evaluating its prognostic accuracy for progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD), comparing semiquantitative with visual scan assessment, and exploring the relationships among Aβ, hippocampal volume (HV) and memory over time.
METHODS: 45 MCI underwent FBB positron emission tomography, MRI and neuropsychological assessment at baseline and 2 years and clinical follow-up at 4 years. Positive FBB (FBB+), defined by a cortical to cerebellar cortex standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) ≥ 1.45, was compared with visual assessment by five readers. Amnestic MCI (aMCI) was defined by a composite episodic memory (EM) Z-score of <-1.5.
RESULTS: At baseline, 24 (53%) MCI were FBB+. Majority reads agreed with SUVR classification (κ 0.96). In 2 years, 18 (75%) FBB+ progressed to AD compared with 2 (9.5%) FBB-, yielding a predictive accuracy of 83% (95% CI 61% to 94%). Four FBB- developed non-AD dementia. Predictive accuracies of HV (58% (95% CI 42% to 73%)) and aMCI status (73% (95% CI 58% to 81%)) were lower. Combinations did not improve accuracy. By 4 years, 21 (87.5%) FBB+ had AD whereas 5 (24%) FBB- had non-AD dementia yielding a predictive accuracy of 94% (95% CI 74% to 99%). While the strong baseline association between FBB SUVR and EM declined over 2 years, the association between EM and HV became stronger. FBB SUVR increased 2.2%/year in FBB+ with no change in FBB-.
CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-florbetaben Aβ imaging facilitates accurate detection of prodromal AD. As neurodegeneration progresses, and in contrast with the early stages of the disease, hippocampal atrophy and not Aβ, seems to drive memory decline.

In some cases this is as trivial as the choice of units, in some cases it is scanner dependent, and of course, different tracers yield different numbers. Our working group was formed to standardize quantitative amyloid imaging measures by scaling the outcome of each particular analysis method or tracer to a 0 to 100 scale, anchored by young controls (≤ 45 years) and typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The units of this scale have been named "Centiloids." Basically, we describe a "standard" method of analyzing PiB PET data and then a method for scaling any "nonstandard" method of PiB PET analysis (or any other tracer) to the Centiloid scale.},

	Abstract = {Functional connectivity (FC) analysis is a prominent approach to analyzing fMRI data, especially acquired under the resting state condition. The commonly used linear correlation FC measure bears an implicit assumption of Gaussianity of the dependence structure. If only the marginals, but not all the bivariate distributions are Gaussian, linear correlation consistently underestimates the strength of the dependence. To assess the suitability of linear correlation and the general potential of nonlinear FC measures, we present a framework for testing and estimating the deviation from Gaussianity by means of comparing mutual information in the data and its Gaussianized counterpart. We apply this method to 24 sessions of human resting state fMRI. For each session, matrix of connectivities between 90 anatomical parcel time series is computed using mutual information and compared to results from its multivariate Gaussian surrogate that conserves the correlations but cancels any nonlinearity. While the group-level tests confirmed non-Gaussianity in the FC, the quantitative assessment revealed that the portion of mutual information neglected by linear correlation is relatively minor-on average only about 5% of the mutual information already captured by the linear correlation. The marginality of the non-Gaussianity was confirmed in comparisons using clustering of the parcels-the disagreement between clustering obtained from mutual information and linear correlation was attributable to random error. We conclude that for this type of data, practical relevance of nonlinear methods trying to improve over linear correlation might be limited by the fact that the data are indeed almost Gaussian.},

	Abstract = {Increased hyperphosphorylated tau and the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are associated with the loss of neurons and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, and related neurodegenerative conditions. We applied two diffusion models, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), to in vivo diffusion magnetic resonance images (dMRI) of a mouse model of human tauopathy (rTg4510) at 8.5months of age. In grey matter regions with the highest degree of tau burden, microstructural indices provided by both NODDI and DTI discriminated the rTg4510 (TG) animals from wild type (WT) controls; however only the neurite density index (NDI) (the volume fraction that comprises axons or dendrites) from the NODDI model correlated with the histological measurements of the levels of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Reductions in diffusion directionality were observed when implementing both models in the white matter region of the corpus callosum, with lower fractional anisotropy (DTI) and higher orientation dispersion (NODDI) observed in the TG animals. In comparison to DTI, histological measures of tau pathology were more closely correlated with NODDI parameters in this region.

	Abstract = {Recent technological progress in the multiband echo planer imaging (MB EPI) technique enables accelerated MR diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and allows whole brain, multi-b-value diffusion imaging to be acquired within a clinically feasible time. However, its applications at 7 T have been limited due to B1 field inhomogeneity and increased susceptibility artifact. It is an ongoing debate whether DWI at 7 T can be performed properly in patients, and a systematic SNR comparison for multiband spin-echo EPI between 3 T and 7 T has not been methodically studied. The goal of this study was to use MB EPI at 7 T in order to obtain 90-directional multi-shell DWI within a clinically feasible acquisition time for patients with glioma. This study included an SNR comparison between 3 T and 7 T, and the application of B1 mapping and distortion correction procedures for reducing the impact of variations in B0 and B1. The optimized multiband sequence was applied in 20 patients with glioma to generate both DTI and NODDI maps for comparison of values in tumor and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Our SNR analysis showed that MB EPI at 7 T was comparable to that at 3 T, and the data quality acquired in patients was clinically acceptable. NODDI maps provided unique contrast within the T2 lesion that was not seen in anatomical images or DTI maps. Such contrast may reflect the complexity of tissue compositions associated with disease progression and treatment effects. The ability to consistently obtain high quality diffusion data at 7 T will contribute towards the implementation of a comprehensive brain MRI examination at ultra-high field.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), a practical diffusion MRI technique for estimating the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo on clinical MRI scanners. Such indices of neurites relate more directly to and provide more specific markers of brain tissue microstructure than standard indices from diffusion tensor imaging, such as fractional anisotropy (FA). Mapping these indices over the whole brain on clinical scanners presents new opportunities for understanding brain development and disorders. The proposed technique enables such mapping by combining a three-compartment tissue model with a two-shell high-angular-resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) protocol optimized for clinical feasibility. An index of orientation dispersion is defined to characterize angular variation of neurites. We evaluate the method both in simulation and on a live human brain using a clinical 3T scanner. Results demonstrate that NODDI provides sensible neurite density and orientation dispersion estimates, thereby disentangling two key contributing factors to FA and enabling the analysis of each factor individually. We additionally show that while orientation dispersion can be estimated with just a single HARDI shell, neurite density requires at least two shells and can be estimated more accurately with the optimized two-shell protocol than with alternative two-shell protocols. The optimized protocol takes about 30 min to acquire, making it feasible for inclusion in a typical clinical setting. We further show that sampling fewer orientations in each shell can reduce the acquisition time to just 10 min with minimal impact on the accuracy of the estimates. This demonstrates the feasibility of NODDI even for the most time-sensitive clinical applications, such as neonatal and dementia imaging.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on MRI for distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from other dementias in autopsy confirmed cases, and to determine pathological correlates of MTA in Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). We studied 46 individuals who had both antemortem MRI and an autopsy. Subjects were clinicopathologically classified as having Alzheimer's disease (n = 11), DLB (n = 23) or VCI (n = 12). MTA was rated visually using a standardized (Scheltens) scale blind to clinical or autopsy diagnosis. Neuropathological analysis included Braak staging as well as quantitative analysis of plaques, tangles and alpha-synuclein Lewy body-associated pathology in the hippocampus. Correlations between MTA and pathological measures were carried out using Spearman's rho, linear regression to assess the contributions of local pathologic changes to MTA. Receiver operator curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic specificity of MTA for Alzheimer's disease among individuals with Alzheimer's disease, DLB and VCI. MTA was a highly accurate diagnostic marker for autopsy confirmed Alzheimer's disease (sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 94%) compared with DLB and VCI. Across the entire sample, correlations were observed between MTA and Braak stage (rho = 0.50, P < 0.001), per cent area of plaques in the hippocampus (rho = 0.37, P = 0.014) and per cent area of tangles in the hippocampus (rho = 0.49, P = 0.001). Linear regression showed Braak stage (P = 0.022) to be a significant predictor of MTA but not percent area of plaques (P = 0.375), percent area of tangles (P = 0.330) or percent area of Lewy bodies (P = 0.086). MTA on MRI had robust discriminatory power for distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from DLB and VCI in pathologically confirmed cases. Pathologically, it is more strongly related to tangle rather than plaque or Lewy body pathology in the temporal lobe. It may have utility as a means for stratifying samples in vivo on the basis of putative differences in pathology.},

@article{cai15,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dilated brain perivascular spaces (PVSs) are found to be associated with many conditions, including aging, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventionally, PVS assessment is mainly based on subjective observations of the number, size and shape of PVSs in MR images collected at clinical field strengths (≤3T). This study tests the feasibility of imaging and quantifying brain PVS with an ultra-high 7T whole-body MRI scanner.
NEW METHOD: 3D high resolution T2-weighted brain images from healthy subjects (n=3) and AD patients (n=5) were acquired on a 7T whole-body MRI scanner. To automatically segment the small hyperintensive fluid-filling PVS structures, we also developed a quantitative program based on algorithms for spatial gradient, component connectivity, edge-detection, k-means clustering, etc., producing quantitative results of white matter PVS volume densities.
RESULTS: The 3D maps of automatically segmented PVS show an apparent increase in PVS density in AD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls due to the PVS dilation (8.0$\pm$2.1 v/v% in AD vs. 4.9$\pm$1.3 v/v% in controls, p<0.05).
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: We demonstrated that 7T provides sufficient SNR and resolution for quantitatively measuring PVSs in deep white matter that is challenging with clinical MRI systems (≤3T). Compared to the conventional visual counting and rating for the PVS assessment, the quantitation method we developed is automatic and objective.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative PVS MRI at 7T may serve as a non-invasive and endogenous imaging biomarker for diseases with PVS dilation.},

@article{cash15,
	Abstract = {Structural MRI is widely used for investigating brain atrophy in many neurodegenerative disorders, with several research groups developing and publishing techniques to provide quantitative assessments of this longitudinal change. Often techniques are compared through computation of required sample size estimates for future clinical trials. However interpretation of such comparisons is rendered complex because, despite using the same publicly available cohorts, the various techniques have been assessed with different data exclusions and different statistical analysis models. We created the MIRIAD atrophy challenge in order to test various capabilities of atrophy measurement techniques. The data consisted of 69 subjects (46 Alzheimer's disease, 23 control) who were scanned multiple (up to twelve) times at nine visits over a follow-up period of one to two years, resulting in 708 total image sets. Nine participating groups from 6 countries completed the challenge by providing volumetric measurements of key structures (whole brain, lateral ventricle, left and right hippocampi) for each dataset and atrophy measurements of these structures for each time point pair (both forward and backward) of a given subject. From these results, we formally compared techniques using exactly the same dataset. First, we assessed the repeatability of each technique using rates obtained from short intervals where no measurable atrophy is expected. For those measures that provided direct measures of atrophy between pairs of images, we also assessed symmetry and transitivity. Then, we performed a statistical analysis in a consistent manner using linear mixed effect models. The models, one for repeated measures of volume made at multiple time-points and a second for repeated "direct" measures of change in brain volume, appropriately allowed for the correlation between measures made on the same subject and were shown to fit the data well. From these models, we obtained estimates of the distribution of atrophy rates in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control groups and of required sample sizes to detect a 25% treatment effect, in relation to healthy ageing, with 95% significance and 80% power over follow-up periods of 6, 12, and 24months. Uncertainty in these estimates, and head-to-head comparisons between techniques, were carried out using the bootstrap. The lateral ventricles provided the most stable measurements, followed by the brain. The hippocampi had much more variability across participants, likely because of differences in segmentation protocol and less distinct boundaries. Most methods showed no indication of bias based on the short-term interval results, and direct measures provided good consistency in terms of symmetry and transitivity. The resulting annualized rates of change derived from the model ranged from, for whole brain: -1.4% to -2.2% (AD) and -0.35% to -0.67% (control), for ventricles: 4.6% to 10.2% (AD) and 1.2% to 3.4% (control), and for hippocampi: -1.5% to -7.0% (AD) and -0.4% to -1.4% (control). There were large and statistically significant differences in the sample size requirements between many of the techniques. The lowest sample sizes for each of these structures, for a trial with a 12month follow-up period, were 242 (95% CI: 154 to 422) for whole brain, 168 (95% CI: 112 to 282) for ventricles, 190 (95% CI: 146 to 268) for left hippocampi, and 158 (95% CI: 116 to 228) for right hippocampi. This analysis represents one of the most extensive statistical comparisons of a large number of different atrophy measurement techniques from around the globe. The challenge data will remain online and publicly available so that other groups can assess their methods.},

	Abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The initial study, ADNI-1, enrolled 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 with early AD, and 200 cognitively normal elderly controls. ADNI-1 was extended by a 2-year Grand Opportunities grant in 2009 and by a competitive renewal, ADNI-2, which enrolled an additional 550 participants and will run until 2015. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results to the end of 2013. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are largely consistent with disease trajectories predicted by β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimer's Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers select and combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, amyloid PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of blood biomarkers for AD as potentially noninvasive and low-cost alternatives to CSF biomarkers for AD diagnosis and the assessment of α-syn as an additional biomarker; (5) the development of methods for the early detection of AD. CSF biomarkers, β-amyloid 42 and tau, as well as amyloid PET may reflect the earliest steps in AD pathology in mildly symptomatic or even nonsymptomatic subjects and are leading candidates for the detection of AD in its preclinical stages; (6) the improvement of clinical trial efficiency through the identification of subjects most likely to undergo imminent future clinical decline and the use of more sensitive outcome measures to reduce sample sizes. Multimodal methods incorporating APOE status and longitudinal MRI proved most highly predictive of future decline. Refinements of clinical tests used as outcome measures such as clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes further reduced sample sizes; (7) the pioneering of genome-wide association studies that leverage quantitative imaging and biomarker phenotypes, including longitudinal data, to confirm recently identified loci, CR1, CLU, and PICALM and to identify novel AD risk loci; (8) worldwide impact through the establishment of ADNI-like programs in Japan, Australia, Argentina, Taiwan, China, Korea, Europe, and Italy; (9) understanding the biology and pathobiology of normal aging, MCI, and AD through integration of ADNI biomarker and clinical data to stimulate research that will resolve controversies about competing hypotheses on the etiopathogenesis of AD, thereby advancing efforts to find disease-modifying drugs for AD; and (10) the establishment of infrastructure to allow sharing of all raw and processed data without embargo to interested scientific investigators throughout the world.},

	Abstract = {Recently, several high dimensional classification methods have been proposed to automatically discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly controls (CN) based on T1-weighted MRI. However, these methods were assessed on different populations, making it difficult to compare their performance. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of ten approaches (five voxel-based methods, three methods based on cortical thickness and two methods based on the hippocampus) using 509 subjects from the ADNI database. Three classification experiments were performed: CN vs AD, CN vs MCIc (MCI who had converted to AD within 18 months, MCI converters - MCIc) and MCIc vs MCInc (MCI who had not converted to AD within 18 months, MCI non-converters - MCInc). Data from 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 39 MCIc and 69 AD were used for training and hyperparameters optimization. The remaining independent samples of 81 CN, 67 MCInc, 37 MCIc and 68 AD were used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the performance of the methods. For AD vs CN, whole-brain methods (voxel-based or cortical thickness-based) achieved high accuracies (up to 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity). For the detection of prodromal AD (CN vs MCIc), the sensitivity was substantially lower. For the prediction of conversion, no classifier obtained significantly better results than chance. We also compared the results obtained using the DARTEL registration to that using SPM5 unified segmentation. DARTEL significantly improved six out of 20 classification experiments and led to lower results in only two cases. Overall, the use of feature selection did not improve the performance but substantially increased the computation times.},

@article{weimer09,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that places substantial burdens on those who provide support for family members with declining cognitive and functional abilities. Many AD patients eventually require formal long-term care services because of the absence, exhaustion, or inability of family members to provide care. The costs of long-term care, and especially nursing home care, often deplete private financial resources, placing a substantial burden on state Medicaid programs. Current evidence suggests that pharmacological treatments and caregiver interventions can delay entry into nursing homes and potentially reduce Medicaid costs. However, these cost savings are not being realized because many patients with AD are either not diagnosed or diagnosed at late stages of the disease, and have no access to Medicare-funded caregiver support programs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A Monte Carlo cost-benefit analysis, based on estimates of parameters available in the medical literature, suggests that the early identification and treatment of AD have the potential to result in large, positive net social benefits as well as positive net savings for states and the federal government.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the early diagnosis and treatment of AD are not only socially desirable in terms of increasing economic efficiency, but also fiscally attractive from both state and federal perspectives. These findings also suggest that failure to fund effective caregiver interventions may be fiscally unsound.},

@article{gomez-isla96,
	Abstract = {The entorhinal cortex (EC) plays a crucial role as a gateway connecting the neocortex and the hippocampal formation. Layer II of the EC gives rise to the perforant pathway, the major source of the excitatory input to the hippocampus, and layer IV receives a major hippocampal efferent projection. The EC is affected severely in Alzheimer disease (AD), likely contributing to memory impairment. We applied stereological principles of neuron counting to determine whether neuronal loss occurs in the EC in the very early stages of AD. We studied 20 individuals who at death had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0 (cognitively normal), 0.5 (very mild), 1 (mild), or 3 (severe cognitive impairment). Lamina-specific neuronal counts were carried out on sections representing the entire EC. In the cognitively normal (CDR = 0) individuals, there were approximately 650,000 neurons in layer II, 1 million neurons in layer IV, and 7 million neurons in the entire EC. The number of neurons remained constant between 60 and 90 years of age. The group with the mildest clinically detectable dementia (CDR = 0.5), all of whom had sufficient neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD, had 32% fewer EC neurons than controls. Decreases in individual lamina were even more dramatic, with the number of neurons in layer II decreasing by 60% and in layer IV by 40% compared with controls. In the severe dementia cases (CDR = 3), the number of neurons in layer II decreased by approximately 90%, and the number of neurons in layer IV decreased by approximately 70% compared with controls. Neuronal number in AD was inversely proportional to NFT formation and neuritic plaques, but was not related significantly to diffuse plaques or to total plaques. These results support the conclusion that a marked decrement of layer II neurons distinguishes even very mild AD from nondemented aging.},

	Abstract = {Two thousand three hundred and thirty two nonselected brains from 1- to 100-year-old individuals were examined using immunocytochemistry (AT8) and Gallyas silver staining for abnormal tau; immunocytochemistry (4G8) and Campbell-Switzer staining were used for the detection ofβ-amyloid. A total of 342 cases was negative in the Gallyas stain but when restaged for AT8 only 10 were immunonegative. Fifty-eight cases had subcortical tau predominantly in the locus coeruleus, but there was no abnormal cortical tau (subcortical Stages a-c). Cortical involvement (abnormal tau in neurites) was identified first in the transentorhinal region (Stage 1a, 38 cases). Transentorhinal pyramidal cells displayed pretangle material (Stage 1b, 236 cases). Pretangles gradually became argyrophilic neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that progressed in parallel with NFT Stages I to VI. Pretangles restricted to subcortical sites were seen chiefly at younger ages. Of the total cases, 1,031 (44.2%) had β-amyloid plaques. The first plaques occurred in the neocortex after the onset of tauopathy in the brainstem. Plaques generally developed in the 40s in 4% of all cases, culminating in their tenth decade (75%). β-amyloid plaques and NFTs were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001). These data suggest that tauopathy associated with sporadic Alzheimer disease may begin earlier than previously thought and possibly in the lower brainstem rather than in the transentorhinal region.},

	Abstract = {Amyloid-β deposition in Alzheimer's disease is thought to start while individuals are still cognitively unimpaired and it is hypothesized that after an early phase of fast accumulation, a plateau is reached by the time of cognitive decline. However, few longitudinal Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography studies have tested this hypothesis, and with conflicting results. The purpose of this work is to further our understanding of the dynamics of amyloid-β deposition in a large longitudinal cohort. A total of 32 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 49 subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 103 healthy controls underwent two Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography scans 18 months apart. For each participant, a parametric map of Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography rate of change was created [(follow-up scan - baseline scan)/follow-up duration] and entered in a voxelwise three-way analysis of covariance, with clinical status (healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease), disease progression (clinical conversion from healthy controls to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, or from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease) and Pittsburgh compound B status (positive versus negative) as independent factors. Only a significant effect of the Pittsburgh compound B status was found: both Pittsburgh compound B-positive and -negative subjects showed a significant increase in amyloid-β deposition, with this increase being significantly higher in Pittsburgh compound B-positive individuals. This finding suggests either that Pittsburgh compound B-negative individuals have slower rates of amyloid-β accumulation than positive, or that the proportion of individuals showing significant increase in amyloid-β deposition, termed 'Pittsburgh compound B accumulators', is higher within the Pittsburgh compound B-positive group than within the Pittsburgh compound B-negative group. The bimodal distribution of the individual rates of neocortical amyloid-β accumulation observed support the existence of 'Pittsburgh compound B non-accumulators' and 'Pittsburgh compound B accumulators' and different clustering analyses led to a consistent threshold to separate these two subgroups (0.014-0.022 standardized uptake value ratio(pons)/year). The voxelwise three-way analysis of covariance was thus recomputed with the 'Pittsburgh compound B accumulators' only and the results were almost unchanged, with the Pittsburgh compound B-positive group showing higher accumulation than the Pittsburgh compound B-negative group. Finally, a significant negative correlation was found between Pittsburgh compound B rate of change and Pittsburgh compound B baseline burden, but only in the Pittsburgh compound B-positive group (r= -0.24; P=0.025). Higher rates of amyloid-β deposition are associated with higher amyloid-β burden suggesting that amyloid-β deposition does not reach a plateau when cognitive impairments manifest but is instead an ongoing process present even at the Alzheimer's disease stage. amyloid-β accumulation also seems to slow down at the latest stages of the process, i.e. in participants with the highest amyloid burden. Furthermore, this study identified the existence of Pittsburgh compound 'accumulators' and 'non-accumulators', notably within the Pittsburgh compound B-negative group, which may be a relevant concept for future studies.},

	Abstract = {Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), an RNA and DNA binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, RNA splicing and RNA metabolism during the stress response, is the major component of neuronal inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions, now referred to as FTLD-TDP. While initially thought to be relatively specific to ALS and FTLD-TDP, TDP-43 pathology has now been detected in a number of other neurodegenerative diseases, many associated with tau pathology, including Guam Parkinson dementia complex and Alzheimer's disease (AD). TDP-43 pathology is detected in 25% to 50% of AD cases, especially those with more severe clinical phenotype and greater Alzheimer type pathology, as well as AD cases with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). HS is characterized by selective neuronal loss affecting CA1 sector of the hippocampus, and most cases of HS, with or without AD, have TDP-43 pathology. Whether TDP-43 pathology is merely an incidental finding in AD or actually contributing to the more severe clinical phenotype remains unresolved. Presence of TDP-43 in normal elderly, who are at increased risk for AD, would strengthen the argument that it is not merely a secondary or incidental finding in end stage AD. Limited studies suggest that TDP-43 pathology is infrequent in neurologically normal elderly (3% or less). We provide an overview of what is known about TDP-43 in AD, normal aging and in other disorders and suggest that TDP-43 proteinopathies be considered in two classes - primary and secondary.},

Theoretical properties of this algorithm are developed along with the corresponding connections to discrete potential theory and electrical circuits. This algorithm is formulated in discrete space (i.e., on a graph) using combinatorial analogues of standard operators and principles from continuous potential theory, allowing it to be applied in arbitrary dimension on arbitrary graphs.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal studies have shown that stress is associated with damage to the hippocampus, inhibition of neurogenesis, and deficits in hippocampal-based memory dysfunction. Studies in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) found deficits in hippocampal-based declarative verbal memory and smaller hippocampal volume, as measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent preclinical evidence has shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors promote neurogenesis and reverse the effects of stress on hippocampal atrophy. This study assessed the effects of long-term treatment with paroxetine on hippocampal volume and declarative memory performance in PTSD.
METHODS: Declarative memory was assessed with the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and Selective Reminding Test before and after 9-12 months of treatment with paroxetine in PTSD. Hippocampal volume was measured with MRI. Of the 28 patients who started the protocol, 23 completed the full course of treatment and neuropsychological testing. Twenty patients were able to complete MRI imaging.
RESULTS: Patients with PTSD showed a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms with treatment. Treatment resulted in significant improvements in verbal declarative memory and a 4.6% increase in mean hippocampal volume.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that long-term treatment with paroxetine is associated with improvement of verbal declarative memory deficits and an increase in hippocampal volume in PTSD.},

	Abstract = {Although cumulative evidence indicates that risk factors for arteriosclerosis have an impact on age-related changes in brain pathology, the influence of aging without major risk factors on changes in brain structures has not yet been fully elucidated. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study how aging affects structural changes in the brain (eg, white matter lesions, hippocampal atrophy [HA], microbleeds) in normal subjects without major risk factors for cerebrovascular diseases. We studied 1108 subjects who underwent voluntary brain screening and had no cerebrovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. We examined the conventional and T2-weighted MRI to define white matter hyperintensities, HA, and cerebral microbleeds in addition to all physical parameters, blood biochemical data, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. We found that the prevalence of white matter lesions and HA increased significantly with age (P < .001). Logistic analysis showed that periventricular hyperintensity was significantly related to age (P < .0001) and depressive state (P < .01). A linear relation was found between white matter lesions and HA (P < .05). Cerebral microbleeds also increased with age, and their presence was associated with HA (P < .001). White matter lesions, HA, and cortical microbleeds were associated with one another in healthy elderly subjects, and these changes were affected by the aging process independent of any cerebrovascular risk factors. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy may underlie these age-related brain changes.},

	Abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The study aimed to enroll 400 subjects with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 200 subjects with early AD, and 200 normal control subjects; $67 million funding was provided by both the public and private sectors, including the National Institute on Aging, 13 pharmaceutical companies, and 2 foundations that provided support through the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health. This article reviews all papers published since the inception of the initiative and summarizes the results as of February 2011. The major accomplishments of ADNI have been as follows: (1) the development of standardized methods for clinical tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in a multicenter setting; (2) elucidation of the patterns and rates of change of imaging and CSF biomarker measurements in control subjects, MCI patients, and AD patients. CSF biomarkers are consistent with disease trajectories predicted by β-amyloid cascade (Hardy, J Alzheimers Dis 2006;9(Suppl 3):151-3) and tau-mediated neurodegeneration hypotheses for AD, whereas brain atrophy and hypometabolism levels show predicted patterns but exhibit differing rates of change depending on region and disease severity; (3) the assessment of alternative methods of diagnostic categorization. Currently, the best classifiers combine optimum features from multiple modalities, including MRI, [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, CSF biomarkers, and clinical tests; (4) the development of methods for the early detection of AD.

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is a very important structure in memory formation and retrieval, as well as in various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and depression. It is composed of many intricate subregions making it difficult to study the anatomical changes that take place during disease. The hippocampal hilus may have a unique neuroanatomy in humans compared to that in monkeys and rodents, with field CA3h greatly enlarged in humans compared to that in rodents, and a white-matter pathway, called the endfolial pathway, possibly only present in humans. In this study we have used newly developed 7.0T whole brain imaging, balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) that can achieve 0.4mm isotropic images to study, in vivo, the anatomy of the hippocampal hilus. A detailed hippocampal subregional segmentation was performed according to anatomic atlases segmenting the following regions: CA4, CA3, CA2, CA1, SRLM (stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare), alveus, fornix, and subiculum along with its molecular layer. We also segmented a hypointense structure centrally within the hilus that resembled the endfolial pathway. To validate that this hypointense signal represented the endfolial pathway, we acquired 0.1mm isotropic 8-phase cycle bSSFP on an excised specimen, and then sectioned and stained the specimen for myelin using an anti-myelin basic protein antibody (SMI 94). A structure tensor analysis was calculated on the myelin-stained section to show directionality of the underlying fibers. The endfolial pathway was consistently visualized within the hippocampal body in vivo in all subjects. It is a central pathway in the hippocampus, with unknown relevance in neurodegenerative disorders, but now that it can be visualized noninvasively, we can study its function and alterations in neurodegeneration.},

	Abstract = {Thompson and Holland (2010) highlight a biologically implausible deceleration of atrophy in results previously published in this journal (Hua et al., 2010); the results were derived using tensor based morphometry on images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. They speculate that bias may have been introduced due to asymmetric interpolation in global image registration, and/or to the use of a statistically defined region of interest. In their reply, Hua et al. (this issue) acknowledge the presence of a bias, but show that it stems largely from an asymmetry in the local image registration algorithm (an asymmetry common to methods in many published studies using nonlinear registration). Hua et al. demonstrate that the bias can largely be removed using a revised symmetric algorithm. This correspondence raises important issues relating to the lack of ground truth against which image analysis methodologies designed to determine atrophy patterns and rates can be assessed; and the increasing importance of striving to avoid potential biases as these techniques become utilised in clinical trials. In the absence of a "gold standard", we discuss a number of steps against which methodologies designed to quantify atrophy from serial scans can be assessed.},

	Abstract = {Longitudinal image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical studies of normal aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.},

	Abstract = {Precise detection and quantification of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) observed in T2-weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is of substantial interest in aging, and age-related neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is mainly because WMH may reflect co-morbid neural injury or cerebral vascular disease burden. WMH in the older population may be small, diffuse, and irregular in shape, and sufficiently heterogeneous within and across subjects. Here, we pose hyperintensity detection as a supervised inference problem and adapt two learning models, specifically, Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, for this task. Using texture features engineered by texton filter banks, we provide a suite of effective segmentation methods for this problem. Through extensive evaluations on healthy middle-aged and older adults who vary in AD risk, we show that our methods are reliable and robust in segmenting hyperintense regions. A measure of hyperintensity accumulation, referred to as normalized effective WMH volume, is shown to be associated with dementia in older adults and parental family history in cognitively normal subjects. We provide an open source library for hyperintensity detection and accumulation (interfaced with existing neuroimaging tools), that can be adapted for segmentation problems in other neuroimaging studies.},

	Abstract = {Neuroanatomically precise, genome-wide maps of transcript distributions are critical resources to complement genomic sequence data and to correlate functional and genetic brain architecture. Here we describe the generation and analysis of a transcriptional atlas of the adult human brain, comprising extensive histological analysis and comprehensive microarray profiling of ∼900 neuroanatomically precise subdivisions in two individuals. Transcriptional regulation varies enormously by anatomical location, with different regions and their constituent cell types displaying robust molecular signatures that are highly conserved between individuals. Analysis of differential gene expression and gene co-expression relationships demonstrates that brain-wide variation strongly reflects the distributions of major cell classes such as neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia. Local neighbourhood relationships between fine anatomical subdivisions are associated with discrete neuronal subtypes and genes involved with synaptic transmission. The neocortex displays a relatively homogeneous transcriptional pattern, but with distinct features associated selectively with primary sensorimotor cortices and with enriched frontal lobe expression. Notably, the spatial topography of the neocortex is strongly reflected in its molecular topography-the closer two cortical regions, the more similar their transcriptomes. This freely accessible online data resource forms a high-resolution transcriptional baseline for neurogenetic studies of normal and abnormal human brain function.},

	Abstract = {Multi-atlas based segmentation has been applied widely in medical image analysis. For label fusion, previous studies show that image similarity-based local weighting techniques produce the most accurate results. However, these methods ignore the correlations between results produced by different atlases. Furthermore, they rely on pre-selected weighting models and ad hoc methods to choose model parameters. We propose a novel label fusion method to address these limitations. Our formulation directly aims at reducing the expectation of the combined error and can be efficiently solved in a closed form. In our hippocampus segmentation experiment, our method significantly outperforms similarity-based local weighting. Using 20 atlases, we produce results with 0.898 +/- 0.019 Dice overlap to manual labelings for controls.},

Using image similarities from image patches to estimate the pairwise dependencies, we showed promising performance. To address the unreliability in purely using local image similarity for dependency estimation, we propose to improve the accuracy of the estimated dependencies by including empirical knowledge, which is learned from the atlases in a leave-one-out strategy.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies discovered that the hippocampal subfields are differentially affected by pathological damage, and magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging parameters might be more sensitive measures of early degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) than conventional MR imaging techniques. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of the volume of hippocampal subfields and the mean diffusivity (MD) value of hippocampus in discrimination between mild AD and normal aging.
METHODS: A total of 29 patients with mild AD and 30 normal aging were scanned. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to assess the diagnostic significance of the volumes of hippocampal subfields and the MD value of hippocampus.
RESULTS: All hippocampal subfields except right tail atrophied significantly in the mild AD group (P < .05). The relative volumes of right CA1 and subiculum subfields entered the binary logistic regression model. The accuracy was 91.8%, which was improved to 93.9% as the MD value of right hippocampus entered the model.
CONCLUSION: Atrophy was present in almost all hippocampal subfields at mild AD stage. The volumes of CA1 and subiculum were of the most diagnostic significance in discrimination of mild AD, which can be improved by the combination of volume and diffusivity analysis.},

@article{dickerson13,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: New diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been developed using biomarkers aiming to establish whether the clinical syndrome is likely due to underlying AD. We investigated the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in predicting progression from amnesic MCI to dementia, testing the hypotheses that (1) markers of amyloid and neurodegeneration provide distinct and complementary prognostic information over different time intervals, and that (2) evidence of neurodegeneration in amyloid-negative MCI individuals would be useful prognostically.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the ADNI-1 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1) database on all individuals with a baseline diagnosis of MCI, baseline MRI and CSF data, and at least one follow-up visit. MRI data were processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a measure known as the ``AD signature,'' as well as hippocampal volume. The CSF biomarkers amyloid-β, total tau, and phospho tau were also examined. We performed logistic regression analyses to identify the best baseline biomarker predictors of progression to dementia over 1 or 3 years, and Cox regression models to test the utility of these markers for predicting time-to-dementia.
RESULTS: For prediction of dementia in MCI, the AD signature cortical thickness biomarker performed better than hippocampal volume. Although CSF tau measures were better than CSF amyloid-β at predicting dementia within 1 year, the AD signature was better than all CSF measures at prediction over this relatively short-term interval. CSF amyloid-β was superior to tau and AD signature at predicting dementia over 3 years. When CSF amyloid-β was dichotomized using previously published cutoff values and treated as a categorical variable, a multivariate stepwise Cox regression model indicated that both the AD signature MRI marker and the categorical CSF amyloid-β marker were useful in predicting time-to-event diagnosis of AD dementia.
CONCLUSION: In amnesic MCI, short-term (1 year) prognosis of progression to dementia relates strongly to baseline markers of neurodegeneration, with the AD signature MRI biomarker of cortical thickness performing the best among MRI and CSF markers studied here. Longer-term (3 year) prognosis in these individuals was better predicted by a marker indicative of brain amyloid. Prediction of time-to-event in a survival model was predicted by the combination of these biomarkers. These results provide further support for emerging models of the temporal relationship of pathophysiologic events in AD and demonstrate the utility of these biomarkers at the prodromal stage of the illness.},

	Abstract = {Biomarkers of brain Aβ amyloid deposition can be measured either by cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 or Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography imaging. Our objective was to evaluate the ability of Aβ load and neurodegenerative atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging to predict shorter time-to-progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia and to characterize the effect of these biomarkers on the risk of progression as they become increasingly abnormal. A total of 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were identified from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The primary outcome was time-to-progression to Alzheimer's dementia. Hippocampal volumes were measured and adjusted for intracranial volume. We used a new method of pooling cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography measures to produce equivalent measures of brain Aβ load from either source and analysed the results using multiple imputation methods. We performed our analyses in two phases. First, we grouped our subjects into those who were 'amyloid positive' (n = 165, with the assumption that Alzheimer's pathology is dominant in this group) and those who were 'amyloid negative' (n = 53). In the second phase, we included all 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment to evaluate the biomarkers in a sample that we assumed to contain a full spectrum of expected pathologies. In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, amyloid positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment were much more likely to progress to dementia within 2 years than amyloid negative subjects with mild cognitive impairment (50 versus 19%). Among amyloid positive subjects with mild cognitive impairment only, hippocampal atrophy predicted shorter time-to-progression (P < 0.001) while Aβ load did not (P = 0.44). In contrast, when all 218 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were combined (amyloid positive and negative), hippocampal atrophy and Aβ load predicted shorter time-to-progression with comparable power (hazard ratio for an inter-quartile difference of 2.6 for both); however, the risk profile was linear throughout the range of hippocampal atrophy values but reached a ceiling at higher values of brain Aβ load. Our results are consistent with a model of Alzheimer's disease in which Aβ deposition initiates the pathological cascade but is not the direct cause of cognitive impairment as evidenced by the fact that Aβ load severity is decoupled from risk of progression at high levels. In contrast, hippocampal atrophy indicates how far along the neurodegenerative path one is, and hence how close to progressing to dementia. Possible explanations for our finding that many subjects with mild cognitive impairment have intermediate levels of Aβ load include: (i) individual subjects may reach an Aβ load plateau at varying absolute levels; (ii) some subjects may be more biologically susceptible to Aβ than others; and (iii) subjects with mild cognitive impairment with intermediate levels of Aβ may represent individuals with Alzheimer's disease co-existent with other pathologies.},

The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association convened an international workgroup to review the biomarker, epidemiological, and neuropsychological evidence, and to develop recommendations to determine the factors which best predict the risk of progression from "normal" cognition to mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia. We propose a conceptual framework and operational research criteria, based on the prevailing scientific evidence to date, to test and refine these models with longitudinal clinical research studies. These recommendations are solely intended for research purposes and do not have any clinical implications at this time. It is hoped that these recommendations will provide a common rubric to advance the study of preclinical AD, and ultimately, aid the field in moving toward earlier intervention at a stage of AD when some disease-modifying therapies may be most efficacious.},

	Abstract = {The NINCDS-ADRDA and the DSM-IV-TR criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the prevailing diagnostic standards in research; however, they have now fallen behind the unprecedented growth of scientific knowledge. Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid beta or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid beta as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.},

@article{dickerson09,
	Abstract = {The volume of parcellated cortical regions is a composite measure related to both thickness and surface area. It is not clear whether volumetric decreases in medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortical regions in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are due to thinning, loss of surface area, or both, nor is it clear whether aging and AD differ in their effects on these properties. Participants included 28 Younger Normals, 47 Older Normals, and 29 patients with mild AD. T1-weighted MRI data were analyzed using a novel semi-automated protocol (presented in a companion article) to delineate the boundaries of entorhinal (ERC), perirhinal (PRC), and posterior parahippocampal (PPHC) cortical regions and calculate their mean thickness, surface area, and volume. Compared to Younger Normals, Older Normals demonstrated moderately reduced ERC and PPHC volumes, which were due primarily to reduced surface area. In contrast, the expected AD-related reduction in ERC volume was produced by a large reduction in thickness with minimal additional effect (beyond that of aging) on surface area. PRC and PPHC also showed large AD-related reductions in thickness. Of all these MTL morphometric measures, ERC and PRC thinning were the best predictors of poorer episodic memory performance in AD. Although the volumes of MTL cortical regions may decrease with both aging and AD, thickness is relatively preserved in normal aging, while even in its mild clinical stage, AD is associated with a large degree of thinning of MTL cortex. These differential morphometric effects of aging and AD may reflect distinct biologic processes and ultimately may provide insights into the anatomic substrates of change in memory-related functions of MTL cortex.},

	Abstract = {Studying large deformations with a Riemannian approach has been an efficient point of view to generate metrics between deformable objects, and to provide accurate, non ambiguous and smooth matchings between images. In this paper, we study the geodesics of such large deformation diffeomorphisms, and more precisely, introduce a fundamental property that they satisfy, namely the conservation of momentum. This property allows us to generate and store complex deformations with the help of one initial "momentum" which serves as the initial state of a differential equation in the group of diffeomorphisms. Moreover, it is shown that this momentum can be also used for describing a deformation of given visual structures, like points, contours or images, and that, it has the same dimension as the described object, as a consequence of the normal momentum constraint we introduce.},

Once a template is fixed, the space of initial momentum becomes an appropriate space for studying shape via geodesic flow since the flow at any point along the geodesic is completely determined by the momentum at the origin through geodesic shooting equations. The space of initial momentum provides a linear representation of the nonlinear diffeomorphic shape space in which linear statistical analysis can be applied. Specializing to the landmark matching problem of Computational Anatomy, we derive an algorithm for solving the variational problem with respect to the initial momentum and demonstrate principal component analysis (PCA) in this setting with three-dimensional face and hippocampus databases.},

	Abstract = {In Magnetic Resonance Imaging, image resolution is limited by several factors such as hardware or time constraints. In many cases, the acquired images have to be upsampled to match a specific resolution. In such cases, image interpolation techniques have been traditionally applied. However, traditional interpolation techniques are not able to recover high frequency information of the underlying high resolution data. In this paper, a new upsampling method is proposed to recover some of this high frequency information by using a data-adaptive patch-based reconstruction in combination with a subsampling coherence constraint. The proposed method has been evaluated on synthetic and real clinical cases and compared with traditional interpolation methods. The proposed method is shown to outperform classical interpolation methods compared in terms of quantitative measures and visual observation.},

@article{witten09,
	Abstract = {We present a penalized matrix decomposition (PMD), a new framework for computing a rank-K approximation for a matrix. We approximate the matrix X as circumflexX = sigma(k=1)(K) d(k)u(k)v(k)(T), where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X - circumflexX, subject to penalties on u(k) and v(k). This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k), which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the PMD is applied using an L(1)-penalty on v(k) but not on u(k), a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the "SCoTLASS" proposal (Jolliffe and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the SCoTLASS method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the PMD is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We apply this penalized CCA method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and DNA copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

	Abstract = {Rigorous statistical analysis of multimodal imaging datasets is challenging. Mass-univariate methods for extracting correlations between image voxels and outcome measurements are not ideal for multimodal datasets, as they do not account for interactions between the different modalities. The extremely high dimensionality of medical images necessitates dimensionality reduction, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA). These dimensionality reduction techniques, however, consist of contributions from every region in the brain and are therefore difficult to interpret. Recent advances in sparse dimensionality reduction have enabled construction of a set of image regions that explain the variance of the images while still maintaining anatomical interpretability. The projections of the original data on the sparse eigenvectors, however, are highly collinear and therefore difficult to incorporate into multi-modal image analysis pipelines. We propose here a method for clustering sparse eigenvectors and selecting a subset of the eigenvectors to make interpretable predictions from a multi-modal dataset. Evaluation on a publicly available dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms PCA and ICA-based regressions while still maintaining anatomical meaning. To facilitate reproducibility, the complete dataset used and all source code is publicly available.},

	Abstract = {Thirteen families have been described with an autosomal dominantly inherited dementia named frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), historically termed Pick's disease. Most FTDP-17 cases show neuronal and/or glial inclusions that stain positively with antibodies raised against the microtubule-associated protein Tau, although the Tau pathology varies considerably in both its quantity (or severity) and characteristics. Previous studies have mapped the FTDP-17 locus to a 2-centimorgan region on chromosome 17q21.11; the tau gene also lies within this region. We have now sequenced tau in FTDP-17 families and identified three missense mutations (G272V, P301L and R406W) and three mutations in the 5' splice site of exon 10. The splice-site mutations all destabilize a potential stem-loop structure which is probably involved in regulating the alternative splicing of exon10. This causes more frequent usage of the 5' splice site and an increased proportion of tau transcripts that include exon 10. The increase in exon 10+ messenger RNA will increase the proportion of Tau containing four microtubule-binding repeats, which is consistent with the neuropathology described in several families with FTDP-17.},

The "amyloid hypothesis," which is based on molecular defects observed in autosomal-dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), suggests a serial model of causality, whereby elevation of Abeta drives other disease features including tau hyperphosphorylation. Here, we review recent evidence from drug trials, genetic studies, and experimental work in animal models that suggests that an alternative model might exist in late-onset AD (LOAD), the complex and more common form of the disease. Specifically, we hypothesize a "dual pathway" model of causality, whereby Abeta and tau can be linked by separate mechanisms driven by a common upstream driver. This model may account for the results of recent drug trials and, if confirmed, may guide future drug development.},

	Abstract = {Structural changes in neuroanatomical subregions can be measured using serial magnetic resonance imaging scans, and provide powerful biomarkers for detecting and monitoring Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has made a large database of longitudinal scans available, with one of its primary goals being to explore the utility of structural change measures for assessing treatment effects in clinical trials of putative disease-modifying therapies. Several ADNI-funded research laboratories have calculated such measures from the ADNI database and made their results publicly available. Here, using sample size estimates, we present a comparative analysis of the overall results that come from the application of each laboratory's extensive processing stream to the ADNI database. Obtaining accurate measures of change requires correcting for potential bias due to the measurement methods themselves; and obtaining realistic sample size estimates for treatment response, based on longitudinal imaging measures from natural history studies such as ADNI, requires calibrating measured change in patient cohorts with respect to longitudinal anatomical changes inherent to normal aging. We present results showing that significant longitudinal change is present in healthy control subjects who test negative for amyloid-β pathology. Therefore, sample size estimates as commonly reported from power calculations based on total structural change in patients, rather than change in patients relative to change in healthy controls, are likely to be unrealistically low for treatments targeting amyloid-related pathology.

	Abstract = {Algorithms for computer-aided diagnosis of dementia based on structural MRI have demonstrated high performance in the literature, but are difficult to compare as different data sets and methodology were used for evaluation. In addition, it is unclear how the algorithms would perform on previously unseen data, and thus, how they would perform in clinical practice when there is no real opportunity to adapt the algorithm to the data at hand. To address these comparability, generalizability and clinical applicability issues, we organized a grand challenge that aimed to objectively compare algorithms based on a clinically representative multi-center data set. Using clinical practice as the starting point, the goal was to reproduce the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, we evaluated algorithms for multi-class classification of three diagnostic groups: patients with probable Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The diagnosis based on clinical criteria was used as reference standard, as it was the best available reference despite its known limitations. For evaluation, a previously unseen test set was used consisting of 354 T1-weighted MRI scans with the diagnoses blinded. Fifteen research teams participated with a total of 29 algorithms. The algorithms were trained on a small training set (n=30) and optionally on data from other sources (e.g., the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of aging). The best performing algorithm yielded an accuracy of 63.0% and an area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 78.8%. In general, the best performances were achieved using feature extraction based on voxel-based morphometry or a combination of features that included volume, cortical thickness, shape and intensity. The challenge is open for new submissions via the web-based framework: http://caddementia.grand-challenge.org.},

	Abstract = {In 2010, we put forward a hypothetical model of the major biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was received with interest because we described the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers in relation to each other and to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms. Since then, evidence has accumulated that supports the major assumptions of this model. Evidence has also appeared that challenges some of our assumptions, which has allowed us to modify our original model. Refinements to our model include indexing of individuals by time rather than clinical symptom severity; incorporation of interindividual variability in cognitive impairment associated with progression of AD pathophysiology; modifications of the specific temporal ordering of some biomarkers; and recognition that the two major proteinopathies underlying AD biomarker changes, amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, might be initiated independently in sporadic AD, in which we hypothesise that an incident Aβ pathophysiology can accelerate antecedent limbic and brainstem tauopathy.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: An increasing number of human in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have focused on examining the structure and function of the subfields of the hippocampal formation (the dentate gyrus, CA fields 1-3, and the subiculum) and subregions of the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices). The ability to interpret the results of such studies and to relate them to each other would be improved if a common standard existed for labeling hippocampal subfields and parahippocampal subregions. Currently, research groups label different subsets of structures and use different rules, landmarks, and cues to define their anatomical extents. This paper characterizes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the variability in the existing manual segmentation protocols for labeling hippocampal and parahippocampal substructures in MRI, with the goal of guiding subsequent work on developing a harmonized substructure segmentation protocol.
METHOD: MRI scans of a single healthy adult human subject were acquired both at 3T and 7T. Representatives from 21 research groups applied their respective manual segmentation protocols to the MRI modalities of their choice. The resulting set of 21 segmentations was analyzed in a common anatomical space to quantify similarity and identify areas of agreement.
RESULTS: The differences between the 21 protocols include the region within which segmentation is performed, the set of anatomical labels used, and the extents of specific anatomical labels. The greatest overall disagreement among the protocols is at the CA1/subiculum boundary, and disagreement across all structures is greatest in the anterior portion of the hippocampal formation relative to the body and tail.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined examination of the 21 protocols in the same dataset suggests possible strategies towards developing a harmonized subfield segmentation protocol and facilitates comparison between published studies.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia worldwide. Hippocampal atrophy and ventricular enlargement have been associated with AD but also with normal aging. We analyzed 1.5-T brain magnetic resonance imaging data from 46 cognitively normal elderly individuals (NC), 33 mild cognitive impairment and 43 AD patients. Hippocampal and ventricular analyses were conducted with 2 novel semiautomated segmentation approaches followed by the radial distance mapping technique. Multiple linear regression was used to assess the effects of age and diagnosis on hippocampal and ventricular volumes and radial distance. In addition, 3-dimensional map correction for multiple comparisons was made with permutation testing. As expected, most significant hippocampal atrophy and ventricular enlargement were seen in the AD versus NC comparison. Mild cognitive impairment patients showed intermediate levels of hippocampal atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Significant effects of age on hippocampal volume and radial distance were seen in the pooled sample and in the NC and AD groups considered separately. Age-associated differences were detected in all hippocampal subfields and in the frontal and body/occipital horn portions of the lateral ventricles. Aging affects both the hippocampus and lateral ventricles independent of AD pathology, and should be included as covariate in all structural, hippocampal, and ventricular analyses when possible.},

	Abstract = {Growing interest has developed in hippocampal subfield volumetry over the past few years and an increasing number of studies use the automatic segmentation algorithm implemented in FreeSurfer. However, this approach has not been validated on standard resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) as used in most studies. We aimed at comparing hippocampal subfield segmentation using FreeSurfer on standard T1-weighted images versus manual delineation on dedicated high-resolution hippocampal scans. Hippocampal subfields were segmented in 133 individuals including 98 cognitively normal controls aged 19-84 years, 17 mild cognitive impairment and 18 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients using both methods. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots were computed to assess the consistency between both methods, and the effects of age and diagnosis were assessed from both measures. Low to moderate ICC (0.31-0.74) were found for the subiculum and other subfields as well as for the whole hippocampus, and the correlations were very low for cornu ammonis (CA)1 (<0.1). FreeSurfer CA1 volume estimates were found to be much lower than those obtained from manual segmentation, and this bias was proportional to the volume of this structure so that no effect of age or AD could be detected on FreeSurfer CA1 volumes. This study points to the differences in the anatomic definition of the subfields between FreeSurfer and manual delineation, especially for CA1, and provides clue for improvement of this automatic technique for potential clinical application on standard T1-weighted MR.

	Abstract = {We compared hippocampal subfield and entorhinal cortex (ERC) volumes between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and controls without cognitive impairment. Additionally, we investigated the relation between age and hippocampal subfields and ERC in controls. We performed ultra-high field 0.7 mm(3) 7Tesla magnetic resonance imaging in 16 patients with amnestic MCI, 9 with AD, and 29 controls. ERC, subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA)1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG)&CA4 were traced on T2-weighted images. Analyses of covariance, adjusted for age, sex, and intracranial volume showed that compared with controls and patients with MCI, patients with AD had significantly smaller ERC, subiculum, CA1, CA3, and DG&CA4 volumes. Trend analyses revealed similar associations between ERC and hippocampal subfields and diagnostic group. Older age was significantly associated with smaller CA1 and DG&CA4 volumes. In conclusion, almost all hippocampal subfields and ERC show volume reductions in patients with AD compared with controls and patients with MCI. Future, larger studies should determine which subfields are affected earliest in the disease process and what mechanisms underlie the volume loss.},

	Abstract = {The involvement of the hippocampus (HC) in episodic memory is well accepted; however it is unclear how each subfield within the HC contributes to memory function. Recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest differential involvement of hippocampal subfields and subregions in episodic memory. However, most structural MRI studies have examined the HC subfields within a single subregion of the HC and used specialised experimental memory paradigms. The purpose of the present study was to determine the association between volumes of HC subfields throughout the entire HC structure and performance on standard neuropsychological memory tests in a young, healthy population. We recruited 34 healthy participants under the age of 50. MRI data was acquired with a fast spin echo (FSE) sequence yielding a 0.52×0.68×1.0 mm(3) native resolution. The HC subfields - the cornu ammonis 1-3 (CA), dentate gyrus (DG), and subiculum (SUB) - were segmented manually within three hippocampal subregions using a previously defined protocol. Participants were administered the Wechsler Memory Scale, 4th edition (WMS-IV) to assess performance in episodic memory using verbal (Logical Memory, LM) and visual (Designs, DE; visual-spatial memory, DE-Spatial; visual-content memory, DE-Content) memory subtests. Working memory subtests (Spatial Addition, SA; and Symbol Span, SSP) were included as well. Working memory was not associated with any HC volumes. Volumes of the DG were correlated with verbal memory (LM) and visual-spatial memory (DE-Spatial). Posterior CA volumes correlated with both visual-spatial and visual-object memory (DE-Spatial, DE-Content). In general, anterior subregion volumes (HC head) correlated with verbal memory, while some anterior and many posterior HC subregion volumes (body and tail) correlated with visual memory scores (DE-Spatial, DE-Content). In addition, while verbal memory showed left-lateralized associations with HC volumes, visual memory was associated with HC volumes bilaterally. This the first study to examine the associations between hippocampal subfield volumes across the entire hippocampal formation with performance in a set of standard memory tasks.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is the brain structure of highest and earliest structural alteration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). New developments in neuroimaging methods recently made it possible to assess the respective involvement of the different hippocampal subfields by mapping atrophy on a 3D hippocampal surface view. In this longitudinal study on patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we used such an approach to map the profile of hippocampal atrophy and its progression over an 18-month follow-up period in rapid converters to AD and "non-converters" compared to age-matched controls. For the sake of comparison, we also assessed the profile of hippocampal atrophy associated with AD and with increasing age in a healthy control population ranging from young adult to elderly. We found major involvement of the lateral part of the superior hippocampus mainly corresponding to the CA1 subfield in MCI and AD while increasing age was mainly associated with subiculum atrophy in the healthy population. Moreover, the CA1 subfield also showed highest atrophy rates during follow-up, in both rapid converters and "non-converters" although increased effects were observed in the former group. This study emphasizes the differences between normal aging and AD processes leading to hippocampal atrophy, pointing to a specific AD-related CA1 involvement while subiculum atrophy would represent a normal aging process. Our findings also suggest that the degree of hippocampal atrophy, more than its spatial localization, predicts rapid conversion to AD in patients with MCI.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is one of the most age-sensitive brain regions, yet the mechanisms of hippocampal shrinkage remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that hippocampal subfields are differentially vulnerable to aging and differentially sensitive to vascular risk. Promoters of inflammation are frequently proposed as major contributors to brain aging and vascular disease but their effects on hippocampal subfields are unknown. We examined the associations of hippocampal subfield volumes with age, a vascular risk factor (hypertension), and genetic polymorphisms associated with variation in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels (IL-1β C-511T and IL-6 C-174G) and risk for Alzheimer's disease (APOEε4) in healthy adult volunteers (N = 80; age = 22-82 years). Volumes of three hippocampal subfields, cornu ammonis (CA) 1-2, CA3-dentate gyrus, and the subiculum were manually measured on high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Advanced age was differentially associated with smaller volume of CA1-2, whereas carriers of the T allele of IL-1β C-511T polymorphism had smaller volume of all hippocampal subfields than CC homozygotes did. Neither of the other genetic variants, nor diagnosis of hypertension, was associated with any of the measured volumes. The results support the notion that volumes of age-sensitive brain regions may be affected by pro-inflammatory factors that may be targeted by therapeutic interventions.},

	Abstract = {The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the first brain area to succumb to neurofibrillary tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Postmortem human tissue evaluation suggests that this pathology propagates in an ordered manner, with the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and then CA1 stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare (CA1-SRLM)--two monosynaptically connected structures--exhibiting selective damage. Here, we hypothesized that, if ERC and CA1-SRLM share an early vulnerability to AD pathology, then atrophy should occur in a proportional manner between the two structures. We tested this hypothesis in living humans, using ultra-high field 7.0 T MRI to make fine measurements of MTL microstructure. Among a pool of age-matched healthy controls and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild AD, we found a significant correlation between ERC and CA1-SRLM size that could not be explained by global atrophy affecting the MTL. Of the various structures that contribute axons or dendrites into the CA1-SRLM neuropil, only ERC emerged as a significant predictor of CA1-SRLM size in a linear regression analysis. In contrast, other synaptically connected elements of the MTL did not exhibit size correlations. CA1-SRLM and ERC structural covariance was significant for older controls and not patients, whereas the opposite pattern emerged for a correlation between CA1-SRLM and episodic memory performance. Interestingly, CA1-SRLM and ERC were the only MTL structures to atrophy in older controls relative to a younger comparison group. Together, these findings suggest that ERC and CA1-SRLM share vulnerability to both age and AD-associated atrophy.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To rely on the anatomical organization of the hippocampal formation in understanding whether and how late-life diseases such as diabetes and stroke contribute to age-related cognitive decline.
METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to document brain infarcts and to generate high-resolution functional maps of the hippocampal formation in 240 community-based nondemented elders (mean age, 79.7 years) who received a comprehensive medical evaluation. Sixty participants had type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas 74 had MRI-documented brain infarcts, and the first analysis was designed to pinpoint hippocampal subregions differentially linked to each disorder. Then, guided by the results, additional functional MRI studies in aging rhesus monkeys and mice were used to test proposed mechanisms of dysfunction.
RESULTS: Although both diabetes and brain infarcts were associated with hippocampal dysfunction, each was linked to separate hippocampal subregions, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms. The hippocampal subregion linked to diabetes implicated blood glucose as a pathogenic mechanism, a hypothesis confirmed by imaging aging rhesus monkeys and a mouse model of diabetes. The hippocampal subregion linked to infarcts suggested transient hypoperfusion as a pathogenic mechanism, a hypothesis provisionally confirmed by comparing anatomical patterns across subjects with infarcts in different vascular territories.
INTERPRETATION: Taken together with previous findings, these results clarify how diseases of late life differentially target the hippocampal formation, identify elevations in blood glucose as a contributing cause of age-related memory decline, and suggest specific interventions that can preserve cognitive health.},

	Abstract = {Memory function commonly declines in later life. Whether memory decline represents a disease process or whether it is part of normal aging remains unknown. Here we answer this question by assessing the function of multiple subregions that make up the hippocampal circuit across the human life span. A newly developed MRI approach--designed to detect functional changes in individual hippocampal subregions--was used to assess the hippocampal circuit in 70 subjects between 20 and 88 years of age. Using strict parametric criteria, analysis revealed that function in two hippocampal subregions--the subiculum and the dentate gyrus--decline normally with age. In contrast, function in the entorhinal cortex declines pathologically. Single-subject analysis revealed that hippocampal dysfunction, found in 60% of elders was selectively correlated with memory decline. These results show that memory decline is caused by different mechanisms and suggests how memory decline should be approached clinically.},

	Abstract = {The effects of age, subcortical vascular disease, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele and hypertension on entorhinal cortex (ERC) and hippocampal atrophy rates were explored in a longitudinal MRI study with 42 cognitively normal (CN) elderly subjects from 58 to 87 years old. The volumes of the ERC, hippocampus, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the presence of lacunes were assessed on MR images. Age was significantly associated with increased atrophy rates of 0.04+/-0.02% per year for ERC and 0.05+/-0.02% per year for hippocampus. Atrophy rates of hippocampus, but not that of ERC increased with presence of lacunes, in addition to age. WMH, APOE epsilon4 and hypertension had no significant effect on atrophy rates. In conclusion, age and presence of lacunes should be taken into consideration in imaging studies of CN subjects and AD patients to predict AD progression and assess the response to treatment trials.},

To provide guidance to dementia care practitioners, patients, and caregivers, the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging convened the Amyloid Imaging Taskforce (AIT). The AIT considered a broad range of specific clinical scenarios in which amyloid PET could potentially be used appropriately. Peer-reviewed, published literature was searched to ascertain available evidence relevant to these scenarios, and the AIT developed a consensus of expert opinion. Although empirical evidence of impact on clinical outcomes is not yet available, a set of specific appropriate use criteria (AUC) were agreed on that define the types of patients and clinical circumstances in which amyloid PET could be used. Both appropriate and inappropriate uses were considered and formulated,and are reported and discussed here. Because both dementia care and amyloid PET technology are in active development, these AUC will require periodic reassessment.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To inform whether the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) should change its policy of not returning research results to ADNI participants, we surveyed investigators and research staff about disclosing ADNI biomarker information to research participants, with particular emphasis on amyloid imaging results.
METHODS: In April 2012, just before Food and Drug Administration approval of the amyloid-binding radiotracer, florbetapir, all ADNI investigators and personnel were recruited to complete an anonymous online survey that contained fixed choice and free-text questions.
RESULTS: Although ADNI participants often requested amyloid imaging results (the proportions of investigators who reported requests from more than half of their participants with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment were 20% and 22%, respectively), across all diagnostic groups, the majority of ADNI investigators (approximately 90%) did not return amyloid imaging results to ADNI participants. However, the majority of investigators reported that, if the Food and Drug Administration approved florbetapir, they would support the return of amyloid imaging results to participants with mild cognitive impairment and normal cognition, but they emphasized the need for guidance on how to provide these results to participants and for research to assess the value of returning results as well as how returning results will affect study validity and participant well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: A majority of ADNI investigators support returning amyloid imaging results to ADNI participants. The findings that they want guidance on how to do this and research on the impact of disclosure suggest how to develop and monitor a disclosure process.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Recent advances have made possible the in vivo detection of beta-amyloid (Aβ) pathology using positron emission tomography. While the gold standard for amyloid imaging, carbon-11 labeled Pittsburgh compound B is increasingly being replaced by fluorine-18 labeled radiopharmaceuticals, with three already approved for clinical use by US and European regulatory bodies. Appropriate use criteria proposed by an amyloid imaging taskforce convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging recommend restricting use of this technology to the evaluation of patients with mild cognitive impairment or atypical dementia syndromes. While use among asymptomatic individuals is currently viewed as inappropriate due prognostic uncertainty, elevated levels of brain Aβ among asymptomatic individuals may represent preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid imaging is likewise expected to play a role in the design of clinical trials. Though preliminary results suggest amyloid imaging to possess clinical utility and cost-effectiveness, both domains have yet to be assessed systematically. As the field moves toward adoption of a pro-disclosure stance for amyloid imaging findings, it is imperative that a broad range of stakeholders be involved to ensure the appropriateness of emerging policies and protocols.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have shown that plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) are elevated in patients with important and prevalent adverse health conditions, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and frailty. Higher plasma levels of IL-6, in turn, increase the risk of many conditions associated with aging including age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms underlying this association between IL-6 and cognitive vulnerability remain unclear.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigated the role of IL-6 in brain aging in young (4 mo) and aged (24 mo) wild-type C57BL6 and genetically-matched IL-6(-/-) mice, and determined that IL-6 was necessary and sufficient for increased neuronal expression of the superoxide-producing immune enzyme, NADPH-oxidase, and this was mediated by non-canonical NFkappaB signaling. Furthermore, superoxide production by NADPH-oxidase was directly responsible for age-related loss of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons, neurons essential for normal information processing, encoding, and retrieval in hippocampus and cortex. Targeted deletion of IL-6 or elimination of superoxide by chronic treatment with a superoxide-dismutase mimetic prevented age-related loss of PV-interneurons and reversed age-related cognitive deficits on three standard tests of spatial learning and recall.
CONCLUSIONS: Present results indicate that IL-6 mediates age-related loss of critical PV-expressing GABAergic interneurons through increased neuronal NADPH-oxidase-derived superoxide production, and that rescue of these interneurons preserves cognitive performance in aging mice, suggesting that elevated peripheral IL-6 levels may be directly and mechanistically linked to long-lasting cognitive deficits in even normal older individuals. Further, because PV-interneurons are also selectively affected by commonly used anesthetic agents and drugs, our findings imply that IL-6 levels may predict adverse CNS effects in older patients exposed to these compounds through specific derangements in inhibitory interneurons, and that therapies directed at lowering IL-6 may have cognitive benefits clinically.},

In addition, large (diameter > or = 4.5 mm)-hippocampal low signal foci (LSF) were found within the hippocampus, and their number also correlated with the total number of days depressed.

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is a relentlessly progressing dementing disorder. Major pathological hallmarks include extracellular deposits of amyloid protein and intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes. No remissions occur in the course of the disease. Initial amyloid deposits develop in poorly myelinated areas of the basal neocortex. From there, they spread into adjoining areas and the hippocampus. Deposits eventually infiltrate all cortical areas, including densely myelinated primary fields of the neocortex (stages A-C). Intraneuronal lesions develop initially in the transentorhinal region, then spread in a predictable manner across other areas (stages I-VI). At stages I-II, neurofibrillary changes develop preferentially in the absence of amyloid deposits. A proportion of cases shows early development of amyloid deposits and/or intraneuronal changes. Advanced age is thus not a prerequisite for the evolution of the lesions. Alzheimer's disease is an age-related, not an age-dependent disease. The degree of brain destruction at stages III-IV frequently leads to the appearance of initial clinical symptoms. The stages V-VI representing fully developed Alzheimer's disease are increasingly prevalent with increasing age. The arithmetic means of the stages of both the amyloid-depositing and the neurofibrillary pathology increase with age. Age is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.},

It is the most common cause of dementia with an estimated prevalence of 30 million people worldwide, a number that is expected to quadruple in 40 years. There currently is no effective treatment that delays the onset or slows the progression of AD. However, major scientific advances in the areas of genetics, biochemistry, cell biology, and neuroscience over the past 25 years have changed the way we think about AD. This review discusses some of the challenges to translating these basic molecular and cellular discoveries into clinical therapies.

	Abstract = {The distribution and density of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques was studied in a unique series of cases whose premortem cognitive status had been assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), including 39 nondemented cases (CDR = 0; age, 51-88 years), 15 very mildly demented cases (CDR = 0.5), and 8 severely demented (CDR = 3) cases. The initial formation of tangles and plaques in healthy aging appeared to be independent of each other. Tangles were found in all the nondemented cases, especially in hippocampal and parahippocampal areas; the average tangle concentration increased exponentially with age. In contrast, plaques were absent in some brains up to age 88, and the earliest plaque formation in other cases occurred in the neocortex, in patches of diffuse plaques. Widely distributed neuritic as well as diffuse plaques throughout neocortex and limbic structures characterized a further group of nondemented cases. In these cases there was also a substantial increase over other nondemented cases, both in the number of tangles and in the rate of increase in tangles with age, suggesting an interaction between amyloid and neurofibrillary change at this stage. Such cases closely resemble CDR = 0.5 cases, and it is proposed they represent "preclinical" Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the use of pre-and postcontrast three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images to obtain quantitative regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps and to delineate the vascular system of the brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sagittal 3D pre-and postcontrast T1-weighted images were acquired in 10 patients and two volunteers. The images were processed with a knowledge-based segmentation algorithm to obtain independent blood volume maps of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and blood vessels and to quantitate rCBV in various cortical and deep cortical structures. Localized maximum intensity projection (MIP)-rCBV images were used to reveal the brain's venous system and vascularity in and around any lesions present.
RESULTS: Group-averaged (n = 8) rCBV maps from both GM (4.80% +/- 0.37) and WM (2.02% +/- 0.14) yielded a ratio of GM-to-WM rCBV of 2.38 +/- 0.20. The ratio of rCBV between cortical and deep cortical GM was 1.15. rCBV maps showed better vascular contrast than did the postcontrast images in delineation of blood vessels and in the lesions present in two patients. A localized MIP-rCBV image had more than five times higher vascular contrast-to-noise ratio than that of the postcontrast MIP image.
CONCLUSION: rCBV maps can be obtained in a standard clinical setting and can be used to reveal information on local blood volume.},

	Abstract = {The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region in the hippocampal formation whose function declines in association with human aging and is therefore considered to be a possible source of age-related memory decline. Causal evidence is needed, however, to show that DG-associated memory decline in otherwise healthy elders can be improved by interventions that enhance DG function. We addressed this issue by first using a high-resolution variant of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the precise site of age-related DG dysfunction and to develop a cognitive task whose function localized to this anatomical site. Then, in a controlled randomized trial, we applied these tools to study healthy 50-69-year-old subjects who consumed either a high or low cocoa flavanol-containing diet for 3 months. A high-flavanol intervention was found to enhance DG function, as measured by fMRI and by cognitive testing. Our findings establish that DG dysfunction is a driver of age-related cognitive decline and suggest non-pharmacological means for its amelioration.},

	Abstract = {Accurate assessment of regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) is of critical importance in the study of cerebrovascular disease and other disorders of the central nervous system. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is able to measure rCBV non-invasively with two commonly used methods: the dynamic imaging (DI) and steady state (SS) approaches. In this study, two questions were investigated. First, how do partial volume effects between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) and between epicortical vessels and brain parenchyma affect the estimation of rCBV when using the SS approach? Second, how comparable are the ratios of rCBV in GM to rCBV in WM (rCBV GM/WM) obtained with the two methods? We used a paramagnetic contrast agent, OPTIMARK (Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, MO), at a dose of 0.2 mmol/kg in anesthetized pigs (n = 6) to obtain rCBV maps using both methods. When a 10% rCBV threshold was used to minimize effects from large epicortical vessels, and tissue segmentation was used to separate GM from WM, rCBV values of 4.8 +/- 0.3% and 3.3 +/- 0.5% were obtained for GM and WM, respectively, with the SS approach. Significantly higher rCBV values for both GM (P < 0.001) and WM (P < 0.01) were observed when the contribution from large epicortical vessels was not removed. When tissue segmentation and rCBV thresholding were used on SS data, an rCBV GM/WM ratio of 1.5 +/- 0.2 was obtained. This value did not differ significantly from the rCBV GM/WM ratio of 1.8 +/- 0.6 obtained using the DI approach.},

	Abstract = {The large spatial inhomogeneity in transmit B(1) field (B(1)(+)) observable in human MR images at high static magnetic fields (B(0)) severely impairs image quality. To overcome this effect in brain T(1)-weighted images, the MPRAGE sequence was modified to generate two different images at different inversion times, MP2RAGE. By combining the two images in a novel fashion, it was possible to create T(1)-weighted images where the result image was free of proton density contrast, T(2) contrast, reception bias field, and, to first order, transmit field inhomogeneity. MP2RAGE sequence parameters were optimized using Bloch equations to maximize contrast-to-noise ratio per unit of time between brain tissues and minimize the effect of B(1)(+) variations through space. Images of high anatomical quality and excellent brain tissue differentiation suitable for applications such as segmentation and voxel-based morphometry were obtained at 3 and 7 T. From such T(1)-weighted images, acquired within 12 min, high-resolution 3D T(1) maps were routinely calculated at 7 T with sub-millimeter voxel resolution (0.65-0.85 mm isotropic). T(1) maps were validated in phantom experiments. In humans, the T(1) values obtained at 7 T were 1.15+/-0.06 s for white matter (WM) and 1.92+/-0.16 s for grey matter (GM), in good agreement with literature values obtained at lower spatial resolution. At 3 T, where whole-brain acquisitions with 1 mm isotropic voxels were acquired in 8 min, the T(1) values obtained (0.81+/-0.03 s for WM and 1.35+/-0.05 for GM) were once again found to be in very good agreement with values in the literature.},

	Abstract = {Comprehensive visual and quantitative analysis of in vivo human mitral valve morphology is central to the diagnosis and surgical treatment of mitral valve disease. Real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (3D TEE) is a practical, highly informative imaging modality for examining the mitral valve in a clinical setting. To facilitate visual and quantitative 3D TEE image analysis, we describe a fully automated method for segmenting the mitral leaflets in 3D TEE image data. The algorithm integrates complementary probabilistic segmentation and shape modeling techniques (multi-atlas joint label fusion and deformable modeling with continuous medial representation) to automatically generate 3D geometric models of the mitral leaflets from 3D TEE image data. These models are unique in that they establish a shape-based coordinate system on the valves of different subjects and represent the leaflets volumetrically, as structures with locally varying thickness. In this work, expert image analysis is the gold standard for evaluating automatic segmentation. Without any user interaction, we demonstrate that the automatic segmentation method accurately captures patient-specific leaflet geometry at both systole and diastole in 3D TEE data acquired from a mixed population of subjects with normal valve morphology and mitral valve disease.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Two neuroanatomically dissociable, large-scale cortical memory networks, referred to as the anterior and posterior medial temporal lobe (MTL) networks have recently been described in young adults using resting-state blood oxygen level--dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)--based functional connectivity (fc-BOLD). They have been hypothesized to subserve distinct mnemonic and non-memory cognitive functions and are thought to be associated with differential vulnerability in neurological disorders. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of these functional networks in an older adult population and in a cohort of patients diagnosed with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Anatomic subregions of interest in the \{MTL\} were defined using high-resolution T2-weighted \{MRI\} and used as seeds for defining the putative networks using fc-BOLD. Although the literature has suggested that the posterior \{MTL\} network is particularly vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease, we show that both the networks are affected in MCI, to varying degrees, compared with the control group. Furthermore, cortical thickness in the brain regions defined by these networks was reduced in MCI. },

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A globally harmonized protocol (HarP) for manual hippocampal segmentation based on magnetic resonance has been recently developed by a task force from European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our aim was to produce benchmark labels based on the HarP for manual segmentation.
METHODS: Five experts of manual hippocampal segmentation underwent specific training on the HarP and segmented 40 right and left hippocampi from 10 ADNI subjects on both 1.5 T and 3 T scans. An independent expert visually checked segmentations for compliance with the HarP. Descriptive measures of agreement between tracers were intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of crude volumes and similarity coefficients of three-dimensional volumes.
RESULTS: Two hundred labels have been provided for the 20 magnetic resonance images. Intra- and interrater ICCs were >0.94, and mean similarity coefficients were 1.5 T, 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.75); 3 T, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.74-0.76).
CONCLUSION: Certified benchmark labels have been produced based on the HarP to be used for tracers' training and qualification.},

@article{adler14,
	Abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing effort to analyze the morphometry of hippocampal subfields using both in vivo and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, given that boundaries between subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) are conventionally defined on the basis of microscopic features that often lack discernible signature in MRI, subfield delineation in MRI literature has largely relied on heuristic geometric rules, the validity of which with respect to the underlying anatomy is largely unknown. The development and evaluation of such rules are challenged by the limited availability of data linking MRI appearance to microscopic hippocampal anatomy, particularly in three dimensions (3D). The present paper, for the first time, demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields in a high resolution volumetric MRI dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology. It uses a combination of computational techniques and manual post-processing to map subfield boundaries from a stack of histology images (obtained with 200μm spacing and 5μm slice thickness; stained using the Kluver-Barrera method) onto a postmortem 9.4Tesla MRI scan of the intact, whole hippocampal formation acquired with 160μm isotropic resolution. The histology reconstruction procedure consists of sequential application of a graph-theoretic slice stacking algorithm that mitigates the effects of distorted slices, followed by iterative affine and diffeomorphic co-registration to postmortem MRI scans of approximately 1cm-thick tissue sub-blocks acquired with 200μm isotropic resolution. These 1cm blocks are subsequently co-registered to the MRI of the whole HF. Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated as the average displacement error between boundaries manually delineated in both the histology and MRI following the sequential stages of reconstruction. The methods presented and evaluated in this single-subject study can potentially be applied to multiple hippocampal tissue samples in order to construct a histologically informed MRI atlas of the hippocampal formation.},

	Abstract = {Age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) is a common but disputed entity. It is unclear whether AAMI is a phenomenon of normal aging or an early sign of Alzheimer's disease. The present study aimed to identify possible structural abnormalities in the medial temporal lobe of AAMI subjects. We measured volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala by MRI in 16 AAMI subjects and in 16 age- and sex-matched controls and correlated the volumes with subjects' performance on two visual memory tasks (the Benton and the Heaton visual retention tests) and on a verbal memory task (the Buschke-Fuld Selective Reminding Test). The mean hippocampal and amygdaloid volumes normalized for brain size per se did not differ between the two study groups. In controls, but not in AAMI subjects, the right hippocampus was larger than the left. Accordingly, the volumetric asymmetry between the right and left hippocampi was smaller in AAMI subjects than in controls (Student's t test, p < 0.05). The volume of the right hippocampus (r = 0.37, n = 32, p < 0.05) and the magnitude of the asymmetry between the right and left hippocampi (r = 0.38, n = 32, p < 0.05) correlated with total score on the Benton test. We also found significant correlations between the amygdaloid volumes and the performance on visual memory tests but not with score on the verbal memory test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Our goal was to ascertain the involvement of the temporal lobe in the preclinical (not yet diagnosable) stages of dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) by using MRI-derived volumes. We assessed anatomical subdivisions of the temporal lobe on three groups of carefully screened age- and education-matched elderly individuals: 27 normal elderly (NL), 22 individuals with minimal cognitive impairment (MCI), who did not fulfill DAT criteria but were regarded at high risk for future DAT, and 27 DAT individuals. We found hippocampal volume reductions of 14% for the MCI and 22% for the DAT group compared to the NL group. Utilizing regression analyses and after accounting for gender head size-age, generalized atrophy (CSF), and other temporal lobe subvolumes, the hippocampal volume separated NL from MCI individuals, correctly classifying 74%. For NL and MCI groups combined the hippocampal volume was the only temporal lobe subvolume related to delayed recall memory performance. When contrasting MCI and DAT individuals, the fusiform gyrus volume uniquely improved the ability of the hippocampal volume to separate MCI from DAT individuals from 74 to 80%. Our cross-sectional data suggest that, within the temporal lobe, specific hippocampal volume reductions separated the group at risk for DAT from the normal group. By the time impairments are sufficient to allow a diagnosis of DAT to be made, in addition to the medial temporal lobe volume reductions, the lateral temporal lobe is also showing volume reductions, most saliently involving the fusiform gyrus.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the accuracy of hippocampal and amygdala volume measurements in diagnosing patients in the early stages of Alzheimer disease.
METHODS: Measurements of the hippocampal formation, amygdala, amygdalohippocampal complex (the two measurements summed), caudate nucleus, and ventricles, normalized for total intracranial volume, were obtained on coronal sections (1.5 T, 400/13 [repetition time/echo time], 5 mm) of 13 patients in the mild (minimental status > or = 21) and five patients in the moderate stages of Alzheimer disease (10 < minimental status < 21), and eight age-matched control subjects.
RESULTS: For patients with a minimental status score of 21 or greater, atrophy was significant for the amygdala and hippocampal formation (-36% and -25% for amygdala/total intracranial volume and hippocampal formation/total intracranial volume, respectively), but not for the caudate nucleus. No significant ventricular enlargement was found. For patients with a minimental status score less than 21, atrophy was more severe in all structures studied (amygdala/total intracranial volume, -40%; hippocampal formation/total intracranial volume, -45%; caudate nucleus/total intracranial volume, -21%), and ventricles were enlarged (63%). No overlap was found between Alzheimer disease and control values for the amygdalohippocampal volume, even in the mild stages of the disease. In Alzheimer disease patients, hippocampal formation volumes correlated with the minimental status.
CONCLUSION: Hippocampal and amygdala atrophy is marked and significant in the mild stages of Alzheimer disease. Volumetric measurements of the amygdala and the amygdalohippocampal complex appear more accurate than those of the hippocampal formation alone in distinguishing patients with Alzheimer disease.},

In the present study, 27 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) received a high-resolution MRI scan at baseline and were followed with yearly clinical evaluations. Ten of the 27 patients converted to AD during a 36-month period following the baseline clinical evaluation. Hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes derived from the baseline scan were compared to determine which of these two regions, known to be pathologically involved very early in the course of AD, could best differentiate MCI converters from non-converters. Although both entorhinal and hippocampal volumes were found to be independent predictors of the likelihood of conversion to AD, it was the right hemisphere entorhinal volume that best predicted conversion with a concordance rate of 93.5%.},

@article{bartzokis98,
	Abstract = {The study assessed whether standardizing the angle of image display and controlling for head position in three planes affects the scan-rescan reliability of medial temporal lobe volume measures when very thin (1.5 mm) slices are used. Five volunteers were scanned two times on consecutive days. A three-dimensional MRI sequence acquired whole brain data in 1.4 mm thick coronal slices. The data were displayed as 1.5 mm thick images and were rated both in the originally acquired coronal plane, and after reformatting to correct for head tilt and display the brain in the coronal plane perpendicular to the long axis of the left anterior hippocampus. One rater measured five brain regions (temporal lobe, anterior and posterior hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal horn) on the left and right sides of the two non-reformatted and two reformatted scans to obtain inter-scan variance. Furthermore, most scans were remeasured, to obtain 'reread' variances. All data were log-transformed in order to produce comparable variability across brain regions of different sizes. For all the regions, except the temporal horn, the non-reformatted scans showed significantly larger scan-rescan variability than the reformatted scans. A typical standard deviation for a non-reformatted pair of scans was 0.10, corresponding to 26% error, while a typical value for a reformatted pair of scans was 0.04, corresponding to 10% error. For all the regions, the reread data (intra-rater reliability) gave similar results for both reformatted and non-reformatted images with similar standard deviations (typical value for reread standard deviation was 0.020, corresponding to 5% error). The data suggest that, even when very thin slices are acquired, volume measurement accuracy of gray matter structures in the temporal lobe is considerably improved by controlling for image orientation in three planes. For these structures, the sample size needed to detect a small (5%) within-subject volume change would be halved if reformatted images were used. Image contrast is an additional important factor since the reformatted T1 weighted images used in this study, which have suboptimal CSF/brain contrast, worsened measurement accuracy in the temporal horn.},

	Abstract = {Accurate and reproducible in vivo measurement of hippocampal volumes using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is complicated by the morphological complexity of the structure. Additionally, separation of certain parts of the hippocampus from the adjacent brain structures on MR images is sometimes very difficult. These difficulties have led most investigators to either use arbitrary landmarks or to exclude certain parts of the structure from their measurements. Based on three-dimensional MR data, we have developed a reliable in vivo volumetric measurement of the human hippocampus. In contrast to most of the previously described volumetric MR-based methods, we aimed to sample the entire hippocampal formation using its true anatomical definition. This was accomplished by relying on the capacity of the BRAINS software to simultaneously visualize in multiple planes, to "telegraph" tracings or cursor position from one plane to another, and to simultaneously rely on multispectral data from three different image sets (T1, T2, and tissue classified). The methods for identifying boundaries and measuring the hippocampal volume are described. The method has excellent reliability, sensitivity, and specificity. The method may be of use in studies of structure-function relationships in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, temporal lobe epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Future work will use these measurements as training data for a neural net-based technique to identify the anatomical boundaries automatically.},

	Abstract = {The architecture of the macaque retrosplenial cortex, including its posteroventral extension around and below the splenium of the corpus callosum, was recently characterized (Morris et al. [1999a] Eur. J. Neurosci. 11:2506-2518.). This analysis was made possible by sectioning the posterior cingulate gyrus radially, i.e., in planes that were orthogonal to its line of curvature and that, therefore, preserved the laminar organization of this region. The aim of the present study was to examine the architecture and the limits of the human retrosplenial cortex. Cross sections through the entire posterior cingulate gyrus were obtained by applying the sectioning technique developed in the monkey, so that an explicit comparison could be made between the architecture of the human and the monkey retrosplenial cortex. The present analysis revealed that, as is the case in the macaque brain, the human retrosplenial cortex is composed of granular areas 29a-c and d, and dysgranular/agranular area 30. The human retrosplenial cortex, like that of the macaque monkey, runs, as an arch, around the splenium of the corpus callosum. In the macaque brain, the retrosplenial cortex remains buried within the callosal sulcus throughout its entire course around the splenium. In the human brain, however, the posteroventral segment of the retrosplenial cortex extends on the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere to encompass most of the cortical region commonly referred to as the "isthmus of the cingulate gyrus."},

This procedure includes techniques to segment and unfold the hippocampus, allowing the fusiform, parahippocampal, perirhinal, entorhinal, subicular, and CA fields to be viewed and compared across subjects. Transformation parameters derived from unfolding high-resolution structural images are applied to coplanar, functional images, yielding two-dimensional "unfolded" activation maps of hippocampi. The application of these unfolding techniques greatly enhances the ability of fMRI to localize and characterize signal changes within the medial temporal lobe. Use of this method on a novelty-encoding paradigm reveals a temporal dissociation between activation along the collateral sulcus and activation in the hippocampus proper.},

Gene expression studies in human and rodent species show high levels of KIBRA in the hippocampus, particularly in the subfields. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the KIBRA C→T polymorphism is also associated with volume differences in the human hippocampus and whether specific subfields are differentially affected by KIBRA genotype. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (T2-weighted, voxel size=0.4×0.4 mm, in-plane) was used to manually segment hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA) subfields, dentate gyrus (DG), and the subiculum as well as adjacent medial temporal lobe cortices in healthy carriers and noncarriers of the KIBRA T-allele (rs17070145). Overall, we found that T-carriers had a larger hippocampal volume relative to noncarriers. The structural differences observed were specific to the CA fields and DG regions of the hippocampus, suggesting a potential neural mechanism for the effects of KIBRA on episodic memory performance reported previously.},

	Abstract = {Volumetric changes in the amygdala and hippocampus are relevant to many disorders, but their close proximity makes it difficult to separate these structures by magnetic resonance imaging, leading many volumetric protocols to exclude problematic slices from analysis, or to analyze the amygdalo-hippocampal complex conjointly. The hippocampus tail is also often excluded, because of the difficulty in separating it from the thalamus. We have developed a reliable protocol for volumetric analysis and 3-D reconstruction of the amygdala and hippocampus (as a whole and in its anatomical parts). Twenty volunteers from clinical and healthy populations were recruited. T1-weighted images were acquired at 1.5 Tesla with native spatial resolution of 1.5 mm x 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm. Volumetric analyses were performed blind to diagnosis, using the interactive software package DISPLAY. Inter-rater (intrarater) intraclass correlations for the method were: 0.95 (0.88) for hippocampus tail, 0.83 (0.93) for hippocampus body, 0.95 (0.92) for hippocampus head, 0.96 (0.86) for total hippocampus and 0.86 (0.94) for amygdala. Volumes (mean+/-S.D.) corrected for intracranial volume for this mixed group were for the hippocampal tail: 0.325+/-0.087 cm(3); hippocampal body: 0.662+/-0.120 cm(3); hippocampal head: 1.23+/-0.174 cm(3); total hippocampus: 2.218+/-0.217 cm(3), and amygdala: 0.808+/-0.185 cm(3). In conclusion, the study demonstrates that the amygdala and hippocampal parts can be quantified reliably.},

	Abstract = {Within the medial temporal lobe, both the hippocampus and amygdala are frequently targeted by researchers and clinicians for volumetric analysis based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, different data acquisition techniques, analysis software and anatomical boundaries have in the past made it difficult to compare results of MRI studies from different laboratories. In order to reduce these differences, a segmentation protocol was established with 40 healthy normal control subjects recently scanned in our laboratory. Data acquisition was performed with a three-dimensional gradient echo technique, and scans were corrected for non-uniformity and registered into standard stereotaxic space prior to segmentation. Volumetric analysis was performed manually using three-dimensional software that allows simultaneous analysis of sagittal, coronal and horizontal images. Intra- and inter-rater coefficients yielded correlation coefficients comparable with other protocols. The hippocampal volume was larger in the right hemisphere (3324 versus 3208 mm(3)), while no interhemispheric differences for the amygdala (1154 versus 1160 mm(3)) could be observed. Most importantly, results from recent segmentation protocols for hippocampus and amygdala seem to approach each other with regard to mean volumes and interhemispheric differences. This indicates that the advances in scanning technique, volume preparation and segmentation protocols allow a more precise definition of medial temporal lobe structures with MRI, and that results for mean volumes for hippocampus and amygdala from different laboratories will eventually become comparable.},

	Abstract = {The medial temporal lobe (MTL)-hippocampus and surrounding perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortical areas-has long been known to be critical for long-term memory for events. Recent functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological data in humans performing short-delay tasks suggest that the MTL also contributes to performance even when retention intervals are brief, and single-unit data in rodents reveal sustained, performance-related delay activity in the MTL during delayed-non-match-to-sample tasks. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the relationship between activation in human MTL subregions and performance during a delayed-match-to-sample task with repeated (non-trial-unique) stimuli. On critical trials, the presentation of two faces was followed by a 30 s delay period, after which participants performed two-alternative forced-choice recognition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant delay period activity in anterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex over the 30 s retention interval, with the magnitude of activity being significantly higher on subsequently correct compared with subsequently incorrect trials. In contrast, posterior hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and fusiform gyrus activity linearly increased across the 30 s delay, suggesting an anticipatory response, and activity in parahippocampal cortex and hippocampus was greater during the probe period on correct compared with incorrect trials. These results indicate that at least two patterns of MTL delay period activation-sustained and anticipatory-are present during performance of short-delay recognition memory tasks, providing novel evidence that multiple processes govern task performance. Implications for understanding the role of the hippocampus and surrounding MTL cortical areas in recognition memory after short delays are discussed.},

(2) To test if age-specific volume changes of subfields can be detected. Forty-two healthy controls (21-85 years) and three AD subjects (76-86 years) were studied with a high resolution T2 weighted fast spin echo sequence. The entorhinal cortex (ERC), subiculum, CA1, CA2 and CA3/4 and dentate were marked. A significant correlation between age and CA1 (r=-0.51, p=0.0002) which was most pronounced in the seventh decade of life was found in healthy controls. In AD subjects, CA1 and subiculum were smaller than in age-matched controls. These preliminary findings suggest that measurement of hippocampal subfields may be helpful to distinguish between normal aging and AD.},

	Abstract = {Diseases involving the medial temporal lobes (MTL) such as Alzheimer's disease and mesial temporal sclerosis pose an ongoing diagnostic challenge because of the difficulty in identifying conclusive imaging features, particularly in pre-clinical states. Abnormal neuronal connectivity may be present in the circuitry of the MTL, but current techniques cannot reliably detect those abnormalities. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise in defining putative abnormalities in connectivity, but DTI studies of the MTL performed to date have shown neither dramatic nor consistent differences across patient populations. Conventional DTI methodology provides an inadequate depiction of the complex microanatomy present in the medial temporal lobe because of a typically employed low isotropic resolution of 2.0-2.5 mm, a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and echo-planar imaging (EPI) geometric distortions that are exacerbated by the inhomogeneous magnetic environment at the skull base. In this study, we pushed the resolving power of DTI to near-mm isotropic voxel size to achieve a detailed depiction of mesial temporal microstructure at 3 T. High image fidelity and SNR at this resolution are achieved through several mechanisms: (1) acquiring multiple repetitions of the minimum field of view required for hippocampal coverage to boost SNR; (2) utilizing a single-refocused diffusion preparation to enhance SNR further; (3) performing a phase correction to reduce Rician noise; (4) minimizing distortion and maintaining left-right distortion symmetry with axial-plane parallel imaging; and (5) retaining anatomical and quantitative accuracy through the use of motion correction coupled with a higher-order eddy-current correction scheme. We combined this high-resolution methodology with a detailed segmentation of the MTL to identify tracks in all subjects that may represent the major pathways of the MTL, including the perforant pathway. Tractography performed on a subset of the data identified similar tracks, although they were lesser in number. This detailed analysis of MTL substructure may have applications to clinical populations.},

Although, as in previous reports, the volume of one region (CA1-2) was larger in the young, the difference was due to the presence of hypertensive subjects among the older adults. Among older participants, increased false alarm rate in an associative recognition memory task was linked to reduced CA3-4/DG volume. We discuss the role of the DG in pattern separation and the formation of discrete memory representations.},

	Abstract = {Advanced age and vascular risk negatively affect episodic memory. The hippocampus (HC) is a complex structure, and little is known about the roles of different HC regions in age-related memory declines. Using data from an ongoing longitudinal study, we investigated whether memory functions are related to volumes of specific HC subregions (CA1-2, CA3-4/dentate gyrus, and subiculum). Furthermore, we inquired if arterial hypertension, a common age-related vascular risk factor, modifies age-related differences in HC regional volumes, concurrent memory performance, and improvement in memory over multiple administrations. Healthy adults (n = 49, 52-82 years old) completed associative recognition and free recall tasks. In grouped path models, covariance structures differed between hypertensive and normotensive participants. Whereas larger CA3-4/dentate gyrus volumes predicted greater improvement in associative memory over repeated tests regardless of vascular risk, CA1-2 volumes were associated with improvement in noun recall only in hypertensive participants. Only among hypertensive participants, CA1-2 volumes negatively related to age and CA3-4/dentate gyrus and CA1-2 volumes were associated with performance at the last measurement occasion. These findings suggest that relatively small regions of the HC may play a role in age-related memory declines and that vascular risk factors associated with advanced age may modify that relationship.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Advances in image segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) have demonstrated that multi-atlas approaches improve segmentation over regular atlas-based approaches. These approaches often rely on a large number of such manually segmented atlases (e.g. 30-80) that take significant time and expertise to produce. We present an algorithm, MAGeT-Brain (Multiple Automatically Generated Templates), for the automatic segmentation of the hippocampus that minimises the number of atlases needed whilst still achieving similar agreement to multi-atlas approaches. Thus, our method acts as a reliable multi-atlas approach when using special or hard-to-define atlases that are laborious to construct.
METHOD: MAGeT-Brain works by propagating atlas segmentations to a template library, formed from a subset of target images, via transformations estimated by nonlinear image registration. The resulting segmentations are then propagated to each target image and fused using a label fusion method. We conduct two separate Monte Carlo cross-validation experiments comparing MAGeT-Brain and multi-atlas whole hippocampal segmentation using differing atlas and template library sizes, and registration and label fusion methods. The first experiment is a 10-fold validation (per parameter setting) over 60 subjects taken from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Database (ADNI), and the second is a five-fold validation over 81 subjects having had a first episode of psychosis. In both cases, automated segmentations are compared with manual segmentations following the Pruessner-protocol. Using the best settings found from these experiments, we segment 246 images of the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 1.5T dataset and compare these with segmentations from existing automated methods: FSL FIRST, FreeSurfer, MAPER, and SNT. Finally, we conduct a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) of hippocampal subfield segmentation in standard 3T T1-weighted images, using five high-resolution manually segmented atlases (Winterburn et al., 2013).
RESULTS: In the ADNI cross-validation, using 9 atlases MAGeT-Brain achieves a mean Dice's Similarity Coefficient (DSC) score of 0.869 with respect to manual whole hippocampus segmentations, and also exhibits significantly lower variability in DSC scores than multi-atlas segmentation. In the younger, psychosis dataset, MAGeT-Brain achieves a mean DSC score of 0.892 and produces volumes which agree with manual segmentation volumes better than those produced by the FreeSurfer and FSL FIRST methods (mean difference in volume: 80mm(3), 1600mm(3), and 800mm(3), respectively). Similarly, in the ADNI1:Complete 1Yr 1.5T dataset, MAGeT-Brain produces hippocampal segmentations well correlated (r>0.85) with SNT semi-automated reference volumes within disease categories, and shows a conservative bias and a mean difference in volume of 250mm(3) across the entire dataset, compared with FreeSurfer and FSL FIRST which both overestimate volume differences by 2600mm(3) and 2800mm(3) on average, respectively. Finally, MAGeT-Brain segments the CA1, CA4/DG and subiculum subfields on standard 3T T1-weighted resolution images with DSC overlap scores of 0.56, 0.65, and 0.58, respectively, relative to manual segmentations.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that MAGeT-Brain produces consistent whole hippocampal segmentations using only 9 atlases, or fewer, with various hippocampal definitions, disease populations, and image acquisition types. Additionally, we show that MAGeT-Brain identifies hippocampal subfields in standard 3T T1-weighted images with overlap scores comparable to competing methods.},

	Abstract = {Classically, model-based segmentation procedures match magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes to an expertly labeled atlas using nonlinear registration. The accuracy of these techniques are limited due to atlas biases, misregistration, and resampling error. Multi-atlas-based approaches are used as a remedy and involve matching each subject to a number of manually labeled templates. This approach yields numerous independent segmentations that are fused using a voxel-by-voxel label-voting procedure. In this article, we demonstrate how the multi-atlas approach can be extended to work with input atlases that are unique and extremely time consuming to construct by generating a library of multiple automatically generated templates of different brains (MAGeT Brain). We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for the mouse and human using two different nonlinear registration algorithms (ANIMAL and ANTs). The input atlases consist a high-resolution mouse brain atlas and an atlas of the human basal ganglia and thalamus derived from serial histological data. MAGeT Brain segmentation improves the identification of the mouse anterior commissure (mean Dice Kappa values (K = 0.801), but may be encountering a ceiling effect for hippocampal segmentations. Applying MAGeT Brain to human subcortical structures improves segmentation accuracy for all structures compared to regular model-based techniques (k = 0.845, 0.752, and 0.861 for the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, respectively). Experiments performed with three manually derived input templates suggest that MAGeT Brain can approach or exceed the accuracy of multi-atlas label-fusion segmentation (K = 0.894, 0.815, and 0.895 for the striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus, respectively).},

	Abstract = {Linear registration and motion correction are important components of structural and functional brain image analysis. Most modern methods optimize some intensity-based cost function to determine the best registration. To date, little attention has been focused on the optimization method itself, even though the success of most registration methods hinges on the quality of this optimization. This paper examines the optimization process in detail and demonstrates that the commonly used multiresolution local optimization methods can, and do, get trapped in local minima. To address this problem, two approaches are taken: (1) to apodize the cost function and (2) to employ a novel hybrid global-local optimization method. This new optimization method is specifically designed for registering whole brain images. It substantially reduces the likelihood of producing misregistrations due to being trapped by local minima. The increased robustness of the method, compared to other commonly used methods, is demonstrated by a consistency test. In addition, the accuracy of the registration is demonstrated by a series of experiments with motion correction. These motion correction experiments also investigate how the results are affected by different cost functions and interpolation methods.},

However, a standard procedure is lacking. We operationalize and quantitate landmark differences to help a Delphi panel converge on a set of landmarks. METHODS: One hundred percent of anatomic landmark variability across 12 different protocols for manual segmentation was reduced into four segmentation units (the minimum hippocampus, the alveus/fimbria, the tail, and the subiculum), which were segmented on magnetic resonance images by expert raters to estimate reliability and AD-related atrophy. RESULTS: Intra- and interrater reliability were more than 0.96 and 0.92, respectively, except for the alveus/fimbria, which were 0.86 and 0.77, respectively. Of all AD-related atrophy, the minimum hippocampus contributed to 67%; tail, 24%; alveus/fimbria, 4%; and the subiculum, 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic landmark variability in available protocols can be reduced to four discrete and measurable segmentation units. Their quantitative assessment will help a Delphi panel to define a set of landmarks for a harmonized protocol.},

	Abstract = {Manual segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MR) is the gold standard for evaluating hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nonetheless, different segmentation protocols provide up to 2.5-fold volume differences. Here we surveyed the most frequently used segmentation protocols in the AD literature as a preliminary step for international harmonization. The anatomical landmarks (anteriormost and posteriormost slices, superior, inferior, medial, and lateral borders) were identified from 12 published protocols for hippocampal manual segmentation ([Abbreviation] first author, publication year: [B] Bartzokis, 1998; [C] Convit, 1997; [dTM] deToledo-Morrell, 2004; [H] Haller, 1997; [J] Jack, 1994; [K] Killiany, 1993; [L] Lehericy, 1994; [M] Malykhin, 2007; [Pa] Pantel, 2000; [Pr] Pruessner, 2000; [S] Soininen, 1994; [W] Watson, 1992). The hippocampi of one healthy control and one AD patient taken from the 1.5T MR ADNI database were segmented by a single rater according to each protocol. The accuracy of the protocols' interpretation and translation into practice was checked with lead authors of protocols through individual interactive web conferences. Semantically harmonized landmarks and differences were then extracted, regarding: (a) the posteriormost slice, protocol [B] being the most restrictive, and [H, M, Pa, Pr, S] the most inclusive; (b) inclusion [C, dTM, J, L, M, Pr, W] or exclusion [B, H, K, Pa, S] of alveus/fimbria; (c) separation from the parahippocampal gyrus, [C] being the most restrictive, [B, dTM, H, J, Pa, S] the most inclusive. There were no substantial differences in the definition of the anteriormost slice. This survey will allow us to operationalize differences among protocols into tracing units, measure their impact on the repeatability and diagnostic accuracy of manual hippocampal segmentation, and finally develop a harmonized protocol.},

	Abstract = {A method of using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure retinotopic organization within human cortex is described. The method is based on a visual stimulus that creates a traveling wave of neural activity within retinotopically organized visual areas. We measured the fMRI signal caused by this stimulus in visual cortex and represented the results on images of the flattened cortical sheet. We used the method to locate visual areas and to evaluate the spatial precision of fMRI. Specifically, we: (i) identified the borders between several retinotopically organized visual areas in the posterior occipital lobe; (ii) measured the function relating cortical position to visual field eccentricity within area V1; (iii) localized activity to within 1.1 mm of visual cortex; and (iv) estimated the spatial resolution of the fMRI signal and found that signal amplitude falls to 60% at a spatial frequency of 1 cycle per 9 mm of visual cortex. This spatial resolution is consistent with a linespread whose full width at half maximum spreads across 3.5 mm of visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {The medial temporal lobe (MTL) plays a key role in learning, memory, spatial navigation, emotion, and social behavior. The improvement of noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging, has increased the knowledge about this region and its involvement in cognitive functions and behavior in healthy subjects and in patients with various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, cytoarchitectonic boundaries are not visible on magnetic resonance images (MRI), which makes it difficult to identify precisely the different parts of the MTL (hippocampus, amygdala, temporopolar, perirhinal, entorhinal, and posterior parahippocampal cortices) with imaging techniques, and thus to determine their involvement in normal and pathological functions. Our aim in this study was to define neuroanatomical landmarks visible on MRI, which can facilitate the examination of this region. We examined the boundaries of the MTL regions in 50 post-mortem brains. In eight cases, we also obtained post-mortem MRI on which the MTL boundaries were compared with histological examination before applying them to 26 in vivo MRI of healthy adults. We then defined the most relevant neuroanatomical landmarks that set the rostro-caudal limits of the MTL structures, and we describe a protocol to identify each of these structures on coronal T1-weighted MRI. This will help the structural and functional imaging investigations of the MTL in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders affecting this region.},

	Abstract = {Researchers in clinical and basic neuroscience frequently target structures of the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) for volumetric analysis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In neurodegenerative diseases, a precise volumetric analysis of MTL structures can assist in differential diagnosis and can be used in guiding early treatment. Also, in functional neuroimaging, exact localization is crucial for the correct interpretation of focal MTL activations with respect to specific memory functions. In presently available protocols, precise and consistent volumetric analysis of MTL structures is compromised in numerous ways. Most importantly, in order to cover all structures of the MTL, the researcher is presently forced to combine independently developed segmentation protocols for different structures from different laboratories. This approach limits anatomical precision because these protocols are based on different anatomical guidelines and descriptions that cannot easily be integrated. The segmentation approach presented in this paper was designed to address this issue by presenting segmentation guidelines for all major structures of the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). It was developed directly to complement a volumetric protocol for hippocampus and amygdala (Pruessner et al., 2000, Cereb Cortex 10:433-442), thus allowing volumetric assessment of all major MTL structures in an integrated and consistent manner. Furthermore, it takes into consideration the neuroanatomical appearance of the collateral sulcus by presenting a method to correct the volumes of the surrounding cortices for the variability of this sulcus. The protocol was validated using MR images of 40 healthy normal control subjects (20 men and 20 women, age range 18-42 years). Intra- and interrater coefficients are presented, together with mean values for the volumes of all PHG structures, correlations with age and sex, and tests for hemispheric differences.},

	Abstract = {Memory loss is often the first and most prominent symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD), coinciding with the spread of neurofibrillary pathology from the entorhinal cortex (ERC) to the hippocampus. The apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, in the stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SRLM), are among the earliest targets of this pathology, and atrophy of the CA1-SRLM is apparent in postmortem tissue from patients with mild AD. We previously demonstrated that CA1-SRLM thinning is also apparent in vivo, using ultra-high field 7-Tesla (7T) MRI to obtain high-resolution hippocampal microstructural imaging. Here, we hypothesized that CA1-SRLM thickness would correlate with episodic memory performance among patients with mild AD. We scanned nine patients, using an oblique coronal T2-weighted sequence through the hippocampal body with an in-plane resolution of 220 μm, allowing direct visual identification of subfields - dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3, CA2, CA1, and ERC - and hippocampal strata - SRLM and stratum pyramidale (SP). We present a novel semi-automated method of measuring stratal width that correlated well with manual measurements. We performed multi-domain neuropsychological evaluations that included three tests of episodic memory, yielding composite scores for immediate recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition memory. Strong correlations occurred between delayed recall performance and the widths of CA1-SRLM (r(2)=0.69; p=0.005), CA1-SP (r(2)=0.5; p=0.034), and ERC (r(2)=0.62; p=0.012). The correlation between CA1-SRLM width and delayed recall lateralized to the left hemisphere. DG/CA3 size did not correlate significantly with any aspect of memory performance. These findings highlight a role for 7T hippocampal microstructural imaging in revealing focal structural pathology that correlates with the central cognitive feature of AD.},

	Abstract = {The integrity of the hippocampal formation is necessary for the correct function of declarative memory for facts and events. Normal aging is associated with a widespread decrease in cortical volume, including the hippocampal formation and related cortical areas, although in many cases, memory is only minimally impaired. In the present study, we quantified the extent of the parahippocampal gyrus (entorhinal cortex, as well as the medial temporal lobe proisocortical areas related to memory function, such as temporopolar cortex, perirhinal cortex, and posterior parahippocampal cortex) in 42 control cases. After detailed cytoarchitectonic analysis (based on homology with the nonhuman primate medial temporal lobe), planimetric measurement (calculated area) of a two-dimensional reconstruction of the parahippocampal gyrus was performed, and cases older than 70 years were compared with cases younger than 70 years. All areas showed atrophy with aging (average, entorhinal cortex, 5%; perirhinal cortex, 4%; posterior parahippocampal cortex, 15%; temporal pole, not assessable). Both entorhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortices reached statistical significance. Our results suggest that cortical areas relevant in memory function, and anatomically linked to the hippocampus, present a small degree of atrophy with aging, thereby permitting the reciprocal flow of information between the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex necessary for memory encoding and retrieval.},

@article{lanerolle03,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: This study is a retrospective analysis of the pathology of the hippocampus from patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. We attempted to relate neuronal density, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiologic data, and surgical outcome.
METHODS: Immunostaining patterns for neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, substance P, and dynorphin defined the immunohistochemical characteristics of the hippocampi. Neuronal densities were determined by microscopic cell counts. Sharp electrode recordings from dentate granule cells determined measures of inhibition and excitation.
RESULTS: Patient hippocampi without evidence of sclerosis generally resembled autopsy controls on the basis of neuronal densities of hippocampal subfields and patterns of immunostaining. The nonsclerotic hippocampi were divisible into two subgroups on the basis of neuronal density correlations between hippocampal subfields, the excitability of dentate granule cells, etiology, and surgical outcome. Hippocampi with sclerosis were divisible into those with significant neuronal loss confined to area CA1 and those with neuronal loss throughout the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. In the former, the dentate gyrus resembled in morphology the nonsclerotic hippocampi but with slightly increased excitability of the dentate granule cells. The hippocampi with more extensive neuronal loss had changes in immunostaining patterns associated with the dentate gyrus, correlated with significant hyperexcitability of dentate granule cells. The surgical outcome, with the exception of one group, was good in approximately 70-90%.
CONCLUSIONS: Hippocampi from patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy can be assigned to several groups on the basis of pathophysiology. Different pathologies may represent differing causative mechanisms of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy and be predictive of surgical outcome.},

	Abstract = {In this review, we summarize and discuss recent studies on structural plasticity changes, particularly apoptosis, in the mammalian hippocampus in relation to stress and depression. Apoptosis continues to occur, yet with very low numbers, in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of various species. Stress and steroid exposure modulate the rate of apoptosis in the DG. Contrary to earlier studies, the impact of chronic stress on structural parameters of the hippocampus like cell number and volume, is rather modest, and requires prolonged and severe stress exposure before only small reductions (< 10 %) become detectable. This does not exclude other structural parameters, like synaptic terminal structure, or dendritic arborization from being significantly altered in critical hippocampal subregions like the DG and/or CA3. Neither does it imply that the functional implications of the changes after stress are also modest. Of interest, most of the structural plasticity changes appear transient and are generally reversible after appropiate recovery periods, or following cessation or blockade of the stress or corticosteroid exposure. The temporary slowing down of both apoptosis and adult proliferation, i.e. the DG turnover, after chronic stress will affect the overall composition, average age and identity of DG cells, and will have considerable consequences for the connectivity, input and properties of the hippocampal circuit and thus for memory function. Modulation of apoptosis and neurogenesis, by drugs interfering with stress components like MR and/or GR, and/or mediators of the cell death cascade, may therefore provide important drug targets for the modulation of mood and memory.},

	Abstract = {The essential role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in long-term memory for individual events is well established, yet important questions remain regarding the mnemonic functions of the component structures that constitute the region. Within the hippocampus, recent functional neuroimaging findings suggest that formation of new memories depends on the dentate gyrus and the CA(3) field, whereas the contribution of the subiculum may be limited to retrieval. During encoding, it has been further hypothesized that structures within MTL cortex contribute to encoding in a content-sensitive manner, whereas hippocampal structures may contribute to encoding in a more domain-general manner. In the current experiment, high-resolution fMRI techniques were utilized to assess novelty and subsequent memory effects in MTL subregions for two classes of stimuli--faces and scenes. During scanning, participants performed an incidental encoding (target detection) task with novel and repeated faces and scenes. Subsequent recognition memory was indexed for the novel stimuli encountered during scanning. Analyses revealed voxels sensitive to both novel faces and novel scenes in all MTL regions. However, similar percentages of voxels were sensitive to novel faces and scenes in perirhinal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and a combined region comprising the dentate gyrus, CA(2), and CA(3), whereas parahippocampal cortex, CA(1), and subiculum demonstrated greater sensitivity to novel scene stimuli. Paralleling these findings, subsequent memory effects in perirhinal cortex were observed for both faces and scenes, with the magnitude of encoding activation being related to later memory strength, as indexed by a graded response tracking recognition confidence, whereas subsequent memory effects were scene-selective in parahippocampal cortex. Within the hippocampus, encoding activation in the subiculum correlated with subsequent memory for both stimulus classes, with the magnitude of encoding activation varying in a graded manner with later memory strength. Collectively, these findings suggest a gradient of content sensitivity from posterior (parahippocampal) to anterior (perirhinal) MTL cortex, with MTL cortical regions differentially contributing to successful encoding based on event content. In contrast to recent suggestions, the present data further indicate that the subiculum may contribute to successful encoding irrespective of event content.},

	Abstract = {Numerous studies support the importance of the perirhinal cortex (PRC) and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) in episodic memory. Theories of PRC and PHC function in humans have been informed by neuroanatomical studies of these regions obtained in animal tract-tracing studies, but knowledge of the connectivity of PHC and PRC in humans is limited. To address this issue, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the intrinsic functional connectivity profiles associated with the PRC and PHC both across the neocortex and within the subfields of the hippocampus. In Experiment 1, we acquired standard-resolution whole-brain resting-state fMRI data in 15 participants, and in Experiment 2, we acquired high-resolution resting-state fMRI data targeting the hippocampus in an independent sample of 15 participants. Experiment 1 revealed that PRC showed preferential connectivity with the anterior hippocampus, whereas PHC showed preferential connectivity with posterior hippocampus. Experiment 2 indicated that this anterior-posterior functional connectivity dissociation was more evident for subfields CA1 and subiculum than for a combined CA2/CA3/dentate gyrus region. Finally, whole-brain analyses from Experiment 1 revealed preferential PRC connectivity with an anterior temporal and frontal cortical network, and preferential PHC connectivity with a posterior medial temporal, parietal, and occipital network. These results suggest a framework for refining models of the functional organization of the human medial temporal lobes in which the PRC and PHC are associated with distinct neocortical pathways that, in turn, may differentially interact with regions along the anterior-posterior axis of the hippocampus.},

In this study, we measured volume, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the presubiculum, subiculum, fimbria, cornu ammonis (CA) 1,2-3,4-DG and the whole hippocampus in fifty cognitively intact elder adults between 50 and 75 years of age (20 men, 30 women). Segmentation of hippocampal subfields was performed using FreeSurfer. Individual MD and FA images were coregistered to T1-weighted volumes using FLIRT of FSL. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the effects of age on the anatomical measures of each subfield. In addition, multiple regression analyses were also carried out to assess which of the anatomical measures that showed a correlation with age in the previous analyses, were the best age predictors in the hippocampus. In agreement with previous studies, our results showed a significant association between age and volume (P < 0.001) as well as MD (P < 0.001) in the whole hippocampus. Regarding the specific hippocampal subfields, we found that age had a significant negative effect on volume in CA2-3 (P < 0.001) and CA4-DG (P < 0.001). Importantly, we found a positive effect of age on MD in CA2-3 (P < 0.001) and fimbria (P < 0.001) as well as a negative age effect on FA in the subiculum (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses revealed that the best overall predictors of age in the hippocampus were MD in the fimbria and volume of CA2-3, which explained 73.8% of the age variance. These results indicate that age has an effect both on volume and diffusion tensor imaging measures in different subfields, suggesting they provide complementary information on age-related processes in the hippocampus. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Many segmentation algorithms in medical image analysis use Bayesian modeling to augment local image appearance with prior anatomical knowledge. Such methods often contain a large number of free parameters that are first estimated and then kept fixed during the actual segmentation process. However, a faithful Bayesian analysis would marginalize over such parameters, accounting for their uncertainty by considering all possible values they may take. Here we propose to incorporate this uncertainty into Bayesian segmentation methods in order to improve the inference process. In particular, we approximate the required marginalization over model parameters using computationally efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We illustrate the proposed approach using a recently developed Bayesian method for the segmentation of hippocampal subfields in brain MRI scans, showing a significant improvement in an Alzheimer's disease classification task. As an additional benefit, the technique also allows one to compute informative "error bars" on the volume estimates of individual structures.},

	Abstract = {Non-rigid image registration using free-form deformations (FFD) is a widely used technique in medical image registration. The balance between robustness and accuracy is controlled by the control point grid spacing and the amount of regularization. In this paper, we revisit the classic FFD registration approach and propose a sparse representation for FFDs using the principles of compressed sensing. The sparse free-form deformation model (SFFD) can capture fine local details such as motion discontinuities without sacrificing robustness. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework to accurately estimate smooth as well as discontinuous deformations in 2D and 3D image sequences. Compared to the classic FFD approach, a significant increase in registration accuracy can be observed in natural images (61%) as well as in cardiac MR images (53%) with discontinuous motions.},

	Abstract = {Label fusion based multi-atlas segmentation has proven to be one of the most competitive techniques for medical image segmentation. This technique transfers segmentations from expert-labeled images, called atlases, to a novel image using deformable image registration. Errors produced by label transfer are further reduced by label fusion that combines the results produced by all atlases into a consensus solution. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity is a simple and highly effective label fusion technique. However, one limitation of most weighted voting methods is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this problem, we recently developed the joint label fusion technique and the corrective learning technique, which won the first place of the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge and was one of the top performers in 2013 MICCAI Segmentation: Algorithms, Theory and Applications (SATA) challenge. To make our techniques more accessible to the scientific research community, we describe an Insight-Toolkit based open source implementation of our label fusion methods. Our implementation extends our methods to work with multi-modality imaging data and is more suitable for segmentation problems with multiple labels. We demonstrate the usage of our tools through applying them to the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge brain image dataset and the 2013 SATA challenge canine leg image dataset. We report the best results on these two datasets so far.},

	Abstract = {In this overview to biomedical computing in the cloud, we discussed two primary ways to use the cloud (a single instance or cluster), provided a detailed example using NGS mapping, and highlighted the associated costs. While many users new to the cloud may assume that entry is as straightforward as uploading an application and selecting an instance type and storage options, we illustrated that there is substantial up-front effort required before an application can make full use of the cloud's vast resources. Our intention was to provide a set of best practices and to illustrate how those apply to a typical application pipeline for biomedical informatics, but also general enough for extrapolation to other types of computational problems. Our mapping example was intended to illustrate how to develop a scalable project and not to compare and contrast alignment algorithms for read mapping and genome assembly. Indeed, with a newer aligner such as Bowtie, it is possible to map the entire African genome using one m2.2xlarge instance in 48 hours for a total cost of approximately $48 in computation time. In our example, we were not concerned with data transfer rates, which are heavily influenced by the amount of available bandwidth, connection latency, and network availability. When transferring large amounts of data to the cloud, bandwidth limitations can be a major bottleneck, and in some cases it is more efficient to simply mail a storage device containing the data to AWS (http://aws.amazon.com/importexport/). More information about cloud computing, detailed cost analysis, and security can be found in references.},

	Abstract = {Manual quantitative analysis of cardiac left ventricular function using Multislice CT and MR is arduous because of the large data volume. In this paper, we present a 3-D active shape model (ASM) for semiautomatic segmentation of cardiac CT and MR volumes, without the requirement of retraining the underlying statistical shape model. A fuzzy c-means based fuzzy inference system was incorporated into the model. Thus, relative gray-level differences instead of absolute gray values were used for classification of 3-D regions of interest (ROIs), removing the necessity of training different models for different modalities/acquisition protocols. The 3-D ASM was evaluated using 25 CT and 15 MR datasets. Automatically generated contours were compared to expert contours in 100 locations. For CT, 82.4% of epicardial contours and 74.1% of endocardial contours had a maximum error of 5 mm along 95% of the contour arc length. For MR, those numbers were 93.2% (epicardium) and 91.4% (endocardium). Volume regression analysis revealed good linear correlations between manual and semiautomatic volumes, r(2) >/= 0.98. This study shows that the fuzzy inference 3-D ASM is a robust promising instrument for semiautomatic cardiac left ventricle segmentation. Without retraining its statistical shape component, it is applicable to routinely acquired CT and MR studies.},

@article{peters10,
	Abstract = {Segmentation of medical images can be achieved with the help of model-based algorithms. Reliable boundary detection is a crucial component to obtain robust and accurate segmentation results and to enable full automation. This is especially important if the anatomy being segmented is too variable to initialize a mean shape model such that all surface regions are close to the desired contours. Several boundary detection algorithms are widely used in the literature. Most use some trained image appearance model to characterize and detect the desired boundaries. Although parameters of the boundary detection can vary over the model surface and are trained on images, their performance (i.e., accuracy and reliability of boundary detection) can only be assessed as an integral part of the entire segmentation algorithm. In particular, assessment of boundary detection cannot be done locally and independently on model parameterization and internal energies controlling geometric model properties. In this paper, we propose a new method for the local assessment of boundary detection called Simulated Search. This method takes any boundary detection function and evaluates its performance for a single model landmark in terms of an estimated geometric boundary detection error. In consequence, boundary detection can be optimized per landmark during model training. We demonstrate the success of the method for cardiac image segmentation. In particular we show that the Simulated Search improves the capture range and the accuracy of the boundary detection compared to a traditional training scheme. We also illustrate how the Simulated Search can be used to identify suitable classes of features when addressing a new segmentation task. Finally, we show that the Simulated Search enables multi-modal heart segmentation using a single algorithmic framework. On computed tomography and magnetic resonance images, average segmentation errors (surface-to-surface distances) for the four chambers and the trunks of the large vessels are in the order of 0.8 mm. For 3D rotational X-ray angiography images of the left atrium and pulmonary veins, the average error is 1.3 mm. In all modalities, the locally optimized boundary detection enables fully automatic segmentation.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the usefulness and limitations of echocardiography in optimizing the outcome of percutaneous aortic valve implantation.
BACKGROUND: Percutaneous aortic valve implantation is an emerging technique that has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of aortic valve disease. To date, however, the technique has been limited by technical constraints. Precise positioning of the valve is essential to minimize the potential for paravalvular regurgitation or device migration. Initial experience with device placement utilized fluoroscopic guidance only.
METHODS: Candidates for percutaneous aortic valve implantation were evaluated with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to assess aortic annular dimension and aortic valve hemodynamics. Fifty consecutive patients were deemed suitable for percutaneous aortic valve implantation. Seventy-four percent (37 of 50) of patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during the procedure.
RESULTS: Eighty-six percent (43 of 50) of patients had successful implantation, of which 77% (33 of 43) had TEE. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to determine annular dimension and was useful in guiding correct device sizing. Transesophageal echocardiography was able to successfully guide device implantation in 97% (33 of 34) of patients in whom the native valve was crossed with the percutaneous heart valve. Transesophageal echocardiography was used for the early detection of paravalvular aortic regurgitation (AR) and complemented fluoroscopy in the detection of complications. Additional balloon dilatation of the percutaneous heart valve was performed in 12 patients because of significant paravalvular AR, with 7 showing improvement in AR grade. After the procedure, early outcomes were evaluated using TTE. All patients in whom the device was successfully placed (43 of 50) had improvement in their aortic stenosis. Paravalvular AR, although present in many patients, is usually mild and has not emerged as a significant problem.
CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiography has an important role in case selection, in guiding device placement, and in detecting complications of percutaneous aortic valve implantation.},

The TAVI strategy (decision to implant and choice of the prosthesis' size) was based on manufacturer's recommendations (Edwards-Sapien prosthesis, Edwards Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California).
RESULTS: Correlations between methods were good but the difference between MSCT and TTE (1.22 +/- 1.3 mm) or TEE (1.52 +/- 1.1 mm) was larger than the difference between TTE and TEE (0.6 +/- 0.8 mm; p = 0.03 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Regarding TAVI strategy, agreement between TTE and TEE overall was good (kappa = 0.68), but TAVI strategy would have been different in 8 patients (17%). Agreement between MSCT and TTE or TEE was only modest (kappa = 0.28 and 0.27), and a decision based on MSCT measurements would have modified the TAVI strategy in a large number of patients (40% to 42%). Implantation, performed in 34 patients (76%) based on TEE measurements, was successful in all but 1 patient with grade 3/4 regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients referred for TAVI, measurements of the aortic annulus using TTE, TEE, and MSCT were close but not identical, and the method used has important potential clinical implications on TAVI strategy. In the absence of a gold standard, a strategy based on TEE measurements provided good clinical results.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous aortic valve replacement is an emerging therapy for selected patients with severe aortic stenosis. Preoperative imaging of the aortic root facilitates sizing and deployment of the percutaneous aortic valve replacement device. We compared morphologic characteristics of the aortic root in patients with aortic stenosis versus elderly gender-matched controls using multidetector computed tomography.
METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive subjects with severe calcific aortic stenosis referred for percutaneous aortic valve replacement and 25 elderly gender-matched controls were scanned on a Siemens Definition Dual Source (Siemens Medical, Forchheim, Germany) multidetector computed tomography scanner. Distances from the valve annulus to the coronary artery ostia and sinotubular junction, dimensions of the aortic root, and characteristics of the valve cusps were determined.
RESULTS: Subjects with aortic stenosis had reduced distance from the aortic valve annulus to the inferior margins of the left and right coronary artery ostium and sinotubular junction compared with controls. There were no significant differences in cross-sectional dimensions of the aortic root.
CONCLUSION: The distance from the aortic valve annulus to the coronary artery ostia and sinotubular junction is reduced in patients with aortic stenosis compared with controls. This finding suggests that longitudinal remodeling of the aortic root occurs in calcific aortic stenosis and has implications for the design and deployment of percutaneous aortic valve replacement devices.},

	Abstract = {We describe a new fully automatic method for the segmentation of brain images that contain multiple sclerosis white matter lesions. Multichannel magnetic resonance images are used to delineate multiple sclerosis lesions while segmenting the brain into its major structures. The method is an atlas-based segmentation technique employing a topological atlas as well as a statistical atlas. An advantage of this approach is that all segmented structures are topologically constrained, thereby allowing subsequent processing such as cortical unfolding or diffeomorphic shape analysis techniques. Evaluation with both simulated and real data sets demonstrates that the method has an accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation methods, while simultaneously segmenting the whole brain.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is often used to characterize and quantify multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the brain and spinal cord. The number and volume of lesions have been used to evaluate MS disease burden, to track the progression of the disease and to evaluate the effect of new pharmaceuticals in clinical trials. Accurate identification of MS lesions in MR images is extremely difficult due to variability in lesion location, size and shape in addition to anatomical variability between subjects. Since manual segmentation requires expert knowledge, is time consuming and is subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, many methods have been proposed to automatically segment lesions. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the state of the art in automated multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation. From 1240 hits found initially with PubMed and Google scholar, our selection criteria identified 80 papers that described an automatic lesion segmentation procedure applied to MS. Only 47 of these included quantitative validation with at least one realistic image. In this paper, we describe the complexity of lesion segmentation, classify the automatic MS lesion segmentation methods found, and review the validation methods applied in each of the papers reviewed. Although many segmentation solutions have been proposed, including some with promising results using MRI data obtained on small groups of patients, no single method is widely employed due to performance issues related to the high variability of MS lesion appearance and differences in image acquisition. The challenge remains to provide segmentation techniques that work in all cases regardless of the type of MS, duration of the disease, or MRI protocol, and this within a comprehensive, standardized validation framework. MS lesion segmentation remains an open problem.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in patients who present for the first time with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) can be established with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if the MRI demonstrates demyelinating lesions with dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time (DIT).
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of a single MRI study obtained within the first 3 months after symptom onset in a cohort of patients with a CIS suggestive of multiple sclerosis at presentation.
DESIGN: Multicenter inception cohort with a follow-up of at least 24 months.
SETTING: Referral hospitals. Patients Patients with CIS onset between April 1, 1995, and September 30, 2004, who fulfilled the following criteria were included: (1) age of 14 to 50 years and (2) clinical follow-up for at least 24 months after CIS onset or until development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS), if this occurred within 2 years. Main Outcome Measure All patients underwent 2 comparable brain MRI examinations, the first within 3 months (early) and the second between 3 and 12 months (delayed) after CIS onset. We defined DIS using several existing MRI criteria, and DIT was inferred when there were simultaneous gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions on a single MRI.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty patients were included in the study. The comparison of the diagnostic performance of various MRI criteria for identifying early converters to CDMS showed similar sensitivity and specificity between early and delayed MRIs. In addition, the use of less stringent criteria for DIS yielded better sensitivity and similar specificity, particularly when assessed in the first weeks after CIS onset.
CONCLUSION: A single brain MRI study that demonstrates DIS and shows both gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions that suggest DIT is highly specific for predicting the early development of CDMS, even when the MRI is performed within the first 3 months after the onset of a CIS.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether recurrent epileptic seizures induce brain damage is debated. Disease progression in epilepsy has been evaluated only in a few community-based studies involving patients with seizures well controlled by medication. These studies concluded that epilepsy does not inevitably lead to global cerebral damage.
OBJECTIVE: To track the progression of neocortical atrophy in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using longitudinal and cross-sectional designs.
METHODS: Using a fully automated measure of cortical thickness on MRI, we studied a homogeneous sample of patients with pharmacoresistant TLE. In the longitudinal analysis (n = 18), fixed-effect models were used to quantify cortical atrophy over a mean interscan interval of 2.5 years (range = 7 to 90 months). In the cross-sectional analysis (n = 121), we correlated epilepsy duration and thickness. To dissociate normal aging from pathologic progression, we compared aging effects in TLE to healthy controls.
RESULTS: The longitudinal analysis mapped progression in ipsilateral temporopolar and central and contralateral orbitofrontal, insular, and angular regions. In patients with more than 14 years of disease, atrophy progressed more rapidly in frontocentral and parietal regions that in those with shorter duration. The cross-sectional study showed progressive atrophy in the mesial and superolateral frontal, and parietal cortices.
CONCLUSIONS: Our combined cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis in patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated progressive neocortical atrophy over a mean interval of 2.5 years that is distinct from normal aging, likely representing seizure-induced damage. The cumulative character of atrophy underlies the importance of early surgical treatment in this group of patients.},

	Abstract = {While image alignment has been studied in different areas of computer vision for decades, aligning images depicting different scenes remains a challenging problem. Analogous to optical flow, where an image is aligned to its temporally adjacent frame, we propose SIFT flow, a method to align an image to its nearest neighbors in a large image corpus containing a variety of scenes. The SIFT flow algorithm consists of matching densely sampled, pixelwise SIFT features between two images while preserving spatial discontinuities. The SIFT features allow robust matching across different scene/object appearances, whereas the discontinuity-preserving spatial model allows matching of objects located at different parts of the scene. Experiments show that the proposed approach robustly aligns complex scene pairs containing significant spatial differences. Based on SIFT flow, we propose an alignment-based large database framework for image analysis and synthesis, where image information is transferred from the nearest neighbors to a query image according to the dense scene correspondence. This framework is demonstrated through concrete applications such as motion field prediction from a single image, motion synthesis via object transfer, satellite image registration, and face recognition.},

@article{ou11,
	Abstract = {A general-purpose deformable registration algorithm referred to as "DRAMMS" is presented in this paper. DRAMMS bridges the gap between the traditional voxel-wise methods and landmark/feature-based methods with primarily two contributions. First, DRAMMS renders each voxel relatively distinctively identifiable by a rich set of attributes, therefore largely reducing matching ambiguities. In particular, a set of multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor attributes are extracted and the optimal components are selected, so that they form a highly distinctive morphological signature reflecting the anatomical and geometric context around each voxel. Moreover, the way in which the optimal Gabor attributes are constructed is independent of the underlying image modalities or contents, which renders DRAMMS generally applicable to diverse registration tasks. A second contribution of DRAMMS is that it modulates the registration by assigning higher weights to those voxels having higher ability to establish unique (hence reliable) correspondences across images, therefore reducing the negative impact of those regions that are less capable of finding correspondences (such as outlier regions). A continuously-valued weighting function named "mutual-saliency" is developed to reflect the matching uniqueness between a pair of voxels implied by the tentative transformation. As a result, voxels do not contribute equally as in most voxel-wise methods, nor in isolation as in landmark/feature-based methods. Instead, they contribute according to the continuously-valued mutual-saliency map, which dynamically evolves during the registration process. Experiments in simulated images, inter-subject images, single-/multi-modality images, from brain, heart, and prostate have demonstrated the general applicability and the accuracy of DRAMMS.},

	Abstract = {A large number of algorithms have been developed to perform non-rigid registration and it is a tool commonly used in medical image analysis. The free-form deformation algorithm is a well-established technique, but is extremely time consuming. In this paper we present a parallel-friendly formulation of the algorithm suitable for graphics processing unit execution. Using our approach we perform registration of T1-weighted MR images in less than 1 min and show the same level of accuracy as a classical serial implementation when performing segmentation propagation. This technology could be of significant utility in time-critical applications such as image-guided interventions, or in the processing of large data sets.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the construction of a computational anatomical atlas of the human hippocampus. The atlas is derived from high-resolution 9.4 Tesla MRI of postmortem samples. The main subfields of the hippocampus (cornu ammonis fields CA1, CA2/3; the dentate gyrus; and the vestigial hippocampal sulcus) are labeled in the images manually using a combination of distinguishable image features and geometrical features. A synthetic average image is derived from the MRI of the samples using shape and intensity averaging in the diffeomorphic non-linear registration framework, and a consensus labeling of the template is generated. The agreement of the consensus labeling with manual labeling of each sample is measured, and the effect of aiding registration with landmarks and manually generated mask images is evaluated. The atlas is provided as an online resource with the aim of supporting subfield segmentation in emerging hippocampus imaging and image analysis techniques. An example application examining subfield-level hippocampal atrophy in temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrates the application of the atlas to in vivo studies.},

Using automatic relevance determination, we are able to perform online selection of the number of fibre orientations supported by the data at each voxel, simplifying the problem of tracking in a multi-orientation field. We then apply the identical probabilistic algorithm to tractography in the multi- and single-fibre cases in a number of example systems which have previously been tracked successfully or unsuccessfully with single-fibre tractography. We show that multi-fibre tractography offers significant advantages in sensitivity when tracking non-dominant fibre populations, but does not dramatically change tractography results for the dominant pathways.},

@article{descoteaux09,
	Abstract = {We propose an integral concept for tractography to describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF) estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects. Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to incorrect interpretations of brain functions.},

	Abstract = {Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and tractography allow the non-invasive study of anatomical brain connectivity. However, a gold standard for validating tractography of complex connections is lacking. Using the porcine brain as a highly gyrated brain model, we quantitatively and qualitatively assessed the anatomical validity and reproducibility of in vitro multi-fiber probabilistic tractography against two invasive tracers: the histochemically detectable biotinylated dextran amine and manganese enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Post mortem DWI was used to ensure that most of the sources known to degrade the anatomical accuracy of in vivo DWI did not influence the tracking results. We demonstrate that probabilistic tractography reliably detected specific pathways. Moreover, the applied model allowed identification of the limitations that are likely to appear in many of the current tractography methods. Nevertheless, we conclude that DWI tractography can be a precise tool in studying anatomical brain connectivity.},

@article{wisse12,
	Abstract = {Animal and human autopsy studies suggest that subfields of the hippocampal formation are differentially affected by neuropsychiatric diseases. Therefore, subfield volumes may be more sensitive to effects of disease processes. The few human studies that segmented subfields of the hippocampal formation in vivo either assessed the subfields only in the body of the hippocampus, assessed only three subfields, or did not take the differential angulation of the head of the hippocampus into account. We developed a protocol using 7 Tesla MRI with isotropic voxels to reliably delineate the entorhinal cortex (ERC), subiculum (SUB), CA1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus (DG)&CA4 along the full-length of the hippocampus. Fourteen subjects (aged 54-74 years, 2 men and 12 women) were scanned with a 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence with isotropic voxels of 0.7 × 0.7 × 0.7 mm(3) on a 7 T MRI whole body scanner. Based on previous protocols and extensive anatomic atlases, a new protocol for segmentation of subfields of the hippocampal formation was formulated. ERC, SUB, CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG&CA4 were manually segmented twice by one rater from coronal MR images. Good-to-excellent consistency was found for all subfields (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient's (ICC) varying from 0.74 to 0.98). Accuracy as measured with the Dice Similarity Index (DSI) was above 0.82 for all subfields, with the exception of the smaller subfield CA3 (0.68-0.70). In conclusion, this study shows that it is possible to delineate the main subfields of the hippocampal formation along its full-length in vivo at 7 T MRI. Our data give evidence that this can be done in a reliable manner. Segmentation of subfields in the full-length of the hippocampus may bolster the study of the etiology neuropsychiatric diseases.},

Previous studies attempting to assess the integrity of the PP in humans using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were limited by low resolution and the inability to identify PP fibers specifically. Here we present an application of DTI at ultrahigh submillimeter resolution that has allowed us to successfully identify diffusion signals unique to the PP and compare the intensity of these signals in a sample of young adults and older adults. We report direct evidence of age-related PP degradation in humans in vivo. We find no evidence of such loss in a control pathway, the alveus, suggesting that these findings are not evidence for a global decline. We also find no evidence for specific entorhinal gray matter atrophy. The extent of PP degradation correlated with performance on a word-list learning task sensitive to hippocampal deficits. We also show evidence for gray matter diffusion signals consistent with pyramidal dendrite orientation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Ultrahigh-resolution microstructural DTI is a unique biomarker that can be used in combination with traditional structural and functional neuroimaging methods to enhance detection of Alzheimer disease in its earliest stages, test the effectiveness of new therapies, and monitor disease progression.},

@article{dawe09,
	Abstract = {Unlike in vivo imaging, postmortem MRI allows for invasive examination of the tissue specimen immediately after the MR scan. However, natural tissue decomposition and chemical fixation cause the postmortem tissue's MRI properties to be different from those found in vivo. Moreover, these properties change as postmortem fixation time elapses. The goal of this study was to characterize the T(2) relaxation changes that occur over time in cadaveric human brain hemispheres during fixation. Five hemispheres immersed in formaldehyde solution were scanned on a weekly basis for 3 months postmortem, and once again at 6 months postmortem. The T(2) relaxation times were measured throughout the hemispheres. Over time, T(2) values near the edges of the hemispheres decreased rapidly after death, while T(2) values of deep tissue decreased more slowly. This difference is likely due to the relatively large distance from the hemisphere surface, and other barriers limiting diffusion of formaldehyde molecules to deep tissues. In addition, T(2) values in deep tissue did not continuously decay to a plateau, but instead reached a minimum and then increased to a plateau. This final increase may be due to the effects of prolonged tissue decomposition, a hypothesis that is supported by numerical simulations of the fixation process.},

Here, we have developed a class of tau ligands, phenyl/pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazoles/benzothiazoliums (PBBs), for visualizing diverse tau inclusions in brains of living patients with AD or non-AD tauopathies and animal models of these disorders. In vivo optical and positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of a transgenic mouse model demonstrated sensitive detection of tau inclusions by PBBs. A pyridinated PBB, [(11)C]PBB3, was next applied in a clinical PET study, and its robust signal in the AD hippocampus wherein tau pathology is enriched contrasted strikingly with that of a senile plaque radioligand, [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B ([(11)C]PIB). [(11)C]PBB3-PET data were also consistent with the spreading of tau pathology with AD progression. Furthermore, increased [(11)C]PBB3 signals were found in a corticobasal syndrome patient negative for [(11)C]PIB-PET.},

	Abstract = {Currently available evidence strongly supports the position that the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is related to abnormal processing of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, ultimately leading to formation of Abeta plaques in the brain. This process occurs while individuals are still cognitively normal. Biomarkers of brain beta-amyloidosis are reductions in CSF Abeta(42) and increased amyloid PET tracer retention. After a lag period, which varies from patient to patient, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the dominant pathological processes. Biomarkers of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration are increased CSF tau and structural MRI measures of cerebral atrophy. Neurodegeneration is accompanied by synaptic dysfunction, which is indicated by decreased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET. We propose a model that relates disease stage to AD biomarkers in which Abeta biomarkers become abnormal first, before neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognitive symptoms, and neurodegenerative biomarkers become abnormal later, and correlate with clinical symptom severity.},

	Abstract = {Converging data from rodents and humans have demonstrated an age-related decline in pattern separation abilities (the ability to discriminate among similar experiences). Several studies have proposed the dentate and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus as the potential locus of this change. Specifically, these studies identified rigidity in place cell remapping in similar environments in the CA3. We used high-resolution fMRI to examine activity profiles in the dentate gyrus and CA3 in young and older adults as stimulus similarity was incrementally varied. We report evidence for "representational rigidity" in older adults' dentate/CA3 that is linked to behavioral discrimination deficits. Using ultrahigh-resolution diffusion imaging, we quantified both the integrity of the perforant path as well as dentate/CA3 dendritic changes and found that both were correlated with dentate/CA3 functional rigidity. These results highlight structural and functional alterations in the hippocampal network that predict age-related changes in memory function and present potential targets for intervention.},

	Abstract = {Automatic segmentation of cell nuclei is an essential step in image cytometry and histometry. Despite substantial progress, there is a need to improve accuracy, speed, level of automation, and adaptability to new applications. This paper presents a robust and accurate novel method for segmenting cell nuclei using a combination of ideas. The image foreground is extracted automatically using a graph-cuts-based binarization. Next, nuclear seed points are detected by a novel method combining multiscale Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering constrained by distance-map-based adaptive scale selection. These points are used to perform an initial segmentation that is refined using a second graph-cuts-based algorithm incorporating the method of alpha expansions and graph coloring to reduce computational complexity. Nuclear segmentation results were manually validated over 25 representative images (15 in vitro images and 10 in vivo images, containing more than 7400 nuclei) drawn from diverse cancer histopathology studies, and four types of segmentation errors were investigated. The overall accuracy of the proposed segmentation algorithm exceeded 86%. The accuracy was found to exceed 94% when only over- and undersegmentation errors were considered. The confounding image characteristics that led to most detection/segmentation errors were high cell density, high degree of clustering, poor image contrast and noisy background, damaged/irregular nuclei, and poor edge information. We present an efficient semiautomated approach to editing automated segmentation results that requires two mouse clicks per operation.},

	Abstract = {Tauopathy in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease starts in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and spreads anatomically in a defined pattern. To test whether pathology initiating in the EC spreads through the brain along synaptically connected circuits, we have generated a transgenic mouse model that differentially expresses pathological human tau in the EC and we have examined the distribution of tau pathology at different timepoints. In relatively young mice (10-11 months old), human tau was present in some cell bodies, but it was mostly observed in axons within the superficial layers of the medial and lateral EC, and at the terminal zones of the perforant pathway. In old mice (>22 months old), intense human tau immunoreactivity was readily detected not only in neurons in the superficial layers of the EC, but also in the subiculum, a substantial number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons especially in CA1, and in dentate gyrus granule cells. Scattered immunoreactive neurons were also seen in the deeper layers of the EC and in perirhinal and secondary somatosensory cortex. Immunoreactivity with the conformation-specific tau antibody MC1 correlated with the accumulation of argyrophilic material seen in old, but not young mice. In old mice, axonal human tau immunoreactivity, especially at the endzones of the perforant pathway, was greatly reduced. Relocalization of tau from axons to somatodendritic compartments and propagation of tauopathy to regions outside of the EC correlated with mature tangle formation in neurons in the EC as revealed by thioflavin-S staining. Our data demonstrate propagation of pathology from the EC and support a trans-synaptic mechanism of spread along anatomically connected networks, between connected and vulnerable neurons. In general, the mouse recapitulates the tauopathy that defines the early stages of AD and provides a model for testing mechanisms and functional outcomes associated with disease progression.},

	Abstract = {There is increasing interest in the early phase of Alzheimer's disease before severe neuronal dysfunction occurs, but it is still not known when or where in the central nervous system the underlying pathological process begins. In this review, we discuss the idea of possible disease progression from the locus coeruleus to the transentorhinal region of the cerebral cortex via neuron-to-neuron transmission and transsynaptic transport of tau protein aggregates, and we speculate that such a mechanism together with the very long prodromal period that characterizes Alzheimer's disease may be indicative of a prion-like pathogenesis for this tauopathy. The fact that AT8-immunoreactive abnormal tau aggregates (pretangles) develop within proximal axons of noradrenergic coeruleus projection neurons in the absence of both tau lesions (pretangles, NFTs/NTs) in the transentorhinal region as well as cortical amyloid-β pathology means that currently used neuropathological stages for Alzheimer's disease will have to be reclassified.},

However, the mechanism involved in this hierarchical pattern of disease progression is unknown. We describe a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of human tau P301L is restricted to EC-II. Tau pathology progresses from EC transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to EC neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, CA fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and EC neurons are lost. These data suggest that a sequence of progressive misfolding of tau proteins, circuit-based transfer to new cell populations, and deafferentation induced degeneration are part of a process of tau-induced neurodegeneration.},

	Abstract = {Hyperphosphorylated tau makes up the filamentous intracellular inclusions of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In the disease process, neuronal tau inclusions first appear in the transentorhinal cortex from where they seem to spread to the hippocampal formation and neocortex. Cognitive impairment becomes manifest when inclusions reach the hippocampus, with abundant neocortical tau inclusions and extracellular beta-amyloid deposits being the defining pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. An abundance of tau inclusions, in the absence of beta-amyloid deposits, defines Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and other diseases. Tau mutations cause familial forms of frontotemporal dementia, establishing that tau protein dysfunction is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and dementia. Thus, transgenic mice expressing mutant (for example, P301S) human tau in nerve cells show the essential features of tauopathies, including neurodegeneration and abundant filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. By contrast, mouse lines expressing single isoforms of wild-type human tau do not produce tau filaments or show neurodegeneration. Here we have used tau-expressing lines to investigate whether experimental tauopathy can be transmitted. We show that injection of brain extract from mutant P301S tau-expressing mice into the brain of transgenic wild-type tau-expressing animals induces assembly of wild-type human tau into filaments and spreading of pathology from the site of injection to neighbouring brain regions.},

The presence of both NFTs and amyloid beta (Abeta)-containing senile plaques within the brain is required to confirm the diagnosis of AD. However, the demonstration that familial AD can be caused by mutations that result in increased Abeta production has resulted in AD drug discovery strategies that are largely focused on reducing brain Abeta levels, with substantially less emphasis on tau-directed approaches. This trend may be changing, as there are an increasing number of research programs that are exploring ways to reduce NFTs in AD and related tauopathies. We briefly review recent advances in tau-based drug discovery, with an emphasis on the identification of compounds that inhibit the assembly of tau into multimers and fibrils.},

	Abstract = {Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are prominent neuropathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease and are considered to be targets for therapeutic intervention as well as biomarkers for diagnostic in vivo imaging agents. While there are a number of amyloid-β positron emission tomography (PET) tracers currently in different stages of clinical development and commercialization, there have been very few reports on imaging agents selectively targeting tau aggregates. In search of [18F]-PET tracers that possess great binding affinity and selectivity toward tau tangles, we tested more than 900 compounds utilizing a unique screening process. A competitive autoradiography assay was set up to test compounds for binding to native tau tangles and amyloid-β plaques on human brain tissue sections. In our in vitro assays, the 18F labeled compound [18F]-T808 displayed a high level of binding affinity and good selectivity for tau aggregates over amyloid-β plaques. [18F]-T808 showed rapid uptake and washout in rodent brains. Our in vitro and preclinical in vivo studies suggest that [18F]-T808 possesses suitable properties and characteristics to be a specific and selective PET probe for imaging of paired helical filament tau in human brains.},

@article{small06,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyloid senile plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease that accumulate in the cortical regions of the brain in persons with mild cognitive impairment who are at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Noninvasive methods to detect these abnormal proteins are potentially useful in developing surrogate markers for drug discovery and diagnostics.
METHODS: We enrolled 83 volunteers with self-reported memory problems who had undergone neurologic and psychiatric evaluation and positron-emission tomography (PET). On the basis of cognitive testing, 25 volunteers were classified as having Alzheimer's disease, 28 as having mild cognitive impairment, and 30 as having no cognitive impairment (healthy controls). PET was performed after injection of 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP), a molecule that binds to plaques and tangles in vitro. All subjects also underwent 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET, and 72 underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULTS: Global values for FDDNP-PET binding (average of the values for the temporal, parietal, posterior cingulate, and frontal regions) were lower in the control group than in the group with mild cognitive impairment (P<0.001), and the values for binding in the group with mild cognitive impairment were lower than in the group with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). FDDNP-PET binding differentiated among the diagnostic groups better than did metabolism on FDG-PET or volume on MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: FDDNP-PET scanning can differentiate persons with mild cognitive impairment from those with Alzheimer's disease and those with no cognitive impairment. This technique is potentially useful as a noninvasive method to determine regional cerebral patterns of amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles.},

@article{kepe13,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Currently [18F]FDDNP is the only PET imaging probe with the ability to visualize hyperphosphorylated tau fibrillar aggregates in living subjects. In this work, we evaluate in vivo [18F]FDDNP labeling of brain neuropathology, primarily tau fibrillar aggregates, in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a human tauopathy usually lacking amyloid-β deposits.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with PSP received [18F]FDDNP PET scanning. [18F]FDDNP distribution volume ratios, in reference to cerebellar gray matter, were determined for cortical and subcortical areas and compared with those of patients with Parkinson's disease with short disease duration, and age-matched control subjects without neurodegenerative disorders.
RESULTS: [18F]FDDNP binding was present in subcortical areas (e.g., striatum, thalamus, subthalamic region, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter) regardless of disease severity, with progressive subcortical and cortical involvement as disease severity increased. Brain patterns of [18F]FDDNP binding were entirely consistent with the known pathology distribution for PSP. High midbrain and subthalamic region [18F]FDDNP binding was distinctive for PSP subjects and separated them from controls and patients with Parkinson's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that [18F]FDDNP is a sensitive in vivo PET imaging probe to map and quantify the dynamic regional localization of tau fibrillar aggregates in PSP. Furthermore, [18F]FDDNP PET may provide a tool to detect changes in tau pathology distribution either associated with disease progression or as a treatment biomarker for future tau-specific therapies. Patterns of [18F]FDDNP binding may also be useful in diagnosis early in disease presentation when clinical distinction among neurodegenerative disorders is often difficult.},

@article{whitwell07,
	Abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), particularly the amnestic subtype (aMCI), is considered as a transitional stage between normal aging and a diagnosis of clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aMCI construct is particularly useful as it provides an opportunity to assess a clinical stage which in most subjects represents prodromal AD. The aim of this study was to assess the progression of cerebral atrophy over multiple serial MRI during the period from aMCI to progression to AD. Thirty-three subjects were selected that fulfilled clinical criteria for aMCI and had three serial MRI scans: the first scan approximately 3 years before the diagnosis of AD, the second scan approximately 1 year before, and the third scan at the time of the diagnosis of AD. A group of 33 healthy controls were age and gender-matched to the study cohort. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess patterns of grey matter atrophy in the aMCI subjects at each time-point compared to the control group. Customized templates and prior probability maps were used to avoid normalization and segmentation bias. The pattern of grey matter loss in the aMCI subject scans that were 3 years before the diagnosis of AD was focused primarily on the medial temporal lobes, including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, with some additional involvement of the fusiform gyrus, compared to controls. The extent and magnitude of the cerebral atrophy further progressed by the time the subjects were 1 year before the diagnosis of AD. At this point atrophy in the temporal lobes spread to include the middle temporal gyrus, and extended into more posterior regions of the temporal lobe to include the entire extent of the hippocampus. The parietal lobe also started to become involved. By the time the subjects had progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD the pattern of grey matter atrophy had become still more widespread with more severe involvement of the medial temporal lobes and the temporoparietal association cortices and, for the first time, substantial involvement of the frontal lobes. This pattern of progression fits well with the Braak and Braak neurofibrillary pathological staging scheme in AD. It suggests that the earliest changes occur in the anterior medial temporal lobe and fusiform gyrus, and that these changes occur at least 3 years before progression to the diagnosis of AD. These results also suggest that 3D patterns of grey matter atrophy may help to predict the time to the first diagnosis of AD in subjects with aMCI.},

	Abstract = {Pathology at preclinical and prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may manifest itself as measurable functional change in neuronal networks earlier than detectable structural change. Functional connectivity as measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as a useful tool for studying disease effects on baseline states of neuronal networks. In this study, we use high resolution MRI to label subregions within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a site of early pathology in AD, and report an increase in functional connectivity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment between entorhinal cortex and subregions of the MTL, with the strongest effect in the anterior hippocampus. However, our data also replicated the effects of decreased connectivity of the MTL to other nodes of the default mode network reported by other researchers. This dissociation of changes in functional connectivity within the MTL versus the MTL's connection with other neocortical structures can help enrich the characterization of early stages of disease progression in AD.},

Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) has been long recognized as an effective and sensitive tool for estimating the change in the volume of brain regions over time. This paper demonstrates that a straightforward application of DBM to estimate the change in the volume of the hippocampus can result in substantial bias, i.e., an overestimation of the rate of change in hippocampal volume. In ADNI data, this bias is manifested as a non-zero intercept of the regression line fitted to the 6 and 12 month rates of hippocampal atrophy. The bias is further confirmed by applying DBM to repeat scans of subjects acquired on the same day. This bias appears to be the result of asymmetry in the interpolation of baseline and followup images during longitudinal image registration. Correcting this asymmetry leads to bias-free atrophy estimation.},

Using mouse brains, we show intact-tissue imaging of long-range projections, local circuit wiring, cellular relationships, subcellular structures, protein complexes, nucleic acids and neurotransmitters. CLARITY also enables intact-tissue in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry with multiple rounds of staining and de-staining in non-sectioned tissue, and antibody labelling throughout the intact adult mouse brain. Finally, we show that CLARITY enables fine structural analysis of clinical samples, including non-sectioned human tissue from a neuropsychiatric-disease setting, establishing a path for the transmutation of human tissue into a stable, intact and accessible form suitable for probing structural and molecular underpinnings of physiological function and disease.},

@article{adler13,
	Abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing effort to analyze the morphometry of hippocampal subfields using both in vivo and postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, given that boundaries between subregions of the hippocampal formation (HF) are conventionally defined on the basis of microscopic features that often lack discernible signature in MRI, subfield delineation in MRI literature has largely relied on heuristic geometric rules, the validity of which with respect to the underlying anatomy is largely unknown. The development and evaluation of such rules is challenged by the limited availability of data linking MRI appearance to microscopic hippocampal anatomy, particularly in three dimensions (3D). The present paper, for the first time,demonstrates the feasibility of labeling hippocampal subfields in a high resolution volumetric MRI dataset based directly on microscopic features extracted from histology. It uses a combination of computational techniques and manual post-processing to map subfield boundaries from a stack of histology images (obtained with 200μm spacing and 5μm slice thickness; stained using the Kluver-Barrera method) onto a postmortem 9.4 Tesla MRI scan of the intact, whole hippocampal formation acquired with 160μm isotropic resolution. The histology reconstruction procedure consists of sequential application of a graph-theoretic slice stacking algorithm that mitigates the effects of distorted slices, followed by iterative affine and diffeomorphic co-registration to postmortem MRI scans of approximately 1cm-thick tissue sub-blocks acquired with 200μm isotropic resolution. These 1cm blocks are subsequently co-registered to the MRI of thewhole HF. Reconstruction accuracy is evaluated as the average displacement error between boundaries manually delineated in both the histology and MRI following the sequential stages of reconstruction. The methods presented and evaluated in this single-subject study can potentially be applied to multiple hippocampal tissue samples in order to construct a histologically informed MRI atlas of the hippocampal formation.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine if ultrahigh-field-strength magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be used to detect subregional hippocampal alterations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects provided written consent to participate in this prospective institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant study. T1- and T2-weighted 7-T brain MR images were acquired in 11 healthy subjects and eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In all subjects, images were qualitatively examined for evidence of hippocampal atrophy, signal change, and malrotation with the Bernasconi definition, and digitations of the hippocampal heads were counted (agreement was measured with the κ statistic). Data were analyzed quantitatively with manual subregional hippocampal body segmentation. Subregional data in individual subjects with TLE were compared with data in control subjects to detect deviation from the control range for volume measures on each side and with asymmetry indexes.
RESULTS: All eight patients with TLE had hippocampal abnormalities on the epileptogenic side. Subregional analysis revealed selective lateral Ammon horn atrophy in six patients and diffuse Ammon horn and dentate gyrus atrophy in one patient. Paucity of hippocampal digitations occurred on the epileptogenic side in all patients with TLE and also on the contralateral side in three patients (interrater κ value, 0.80). Hippocampal malrotation was observed in three patients with TLE and four control subjects.
CONCLUSION: Ultrahigh-field-strength MR imaging permitted detection of selectively greater Ammon horn atrophy in patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis. Paucity of digitations is a deformity of the hippocampal head that was detected independent of hippocampal atrophy in patients with mesial TLE.},

	Abstract = {A complete understanding of the hippocampus depends on elucidating the representations and computations that exist in its anatomically distinct subfields. High-resolution structural and functional MRI scanning is starting to permit insights into hippocampal subfields in humans. In parallel, such scanning has facilitated the use of multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine information present in the distributed pattern of activity across voxels. The aim of this study was to combine these two relatively new innovations and deploy MVPA in the hippocampal subfields. Delineating subregions of the human hippocampus, a prerequisite for our study, remains a significant challenge, with extant methods often only examining part of the hippocampus, or being unable to differentiate CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG). We therefore devised a new high-resolution anatomical scanning and subfield segmentation protocol that allowed us to overcome these issues, and separately identify CA1, CA3, DG, and subiculum (SUB) across the whole hippocampus using a standard 3T MRI scanner. We then used MVPA to examine fMRI data associated with a decision-making paradigm involving highly similar scenes that had relevance for the computations that occur in hippocampal subfields. Intra- and inter-rater scores for subfield identification using our procedure confirmed its reliability. Moreover, we found that decoding of information within hippocampal subfields was possible using MVPA, with findings that included differential effects for CA3 and DG. We suggest that MVPA in human hippocampal subfields may open up new opportunities to examine how different types of information are represented and processed at this fundamental level.},

	Abstract = {Although a few automated hippocampal subfield segmentation methods have been developed, the effects of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) on the hippocampal subfield volumes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the hippocampal subfield volume changes and their relationships with various neuropsychological tests in aMCI using an automated hippocampal subfield segmentation technique. Forty-five subjects with aMCI and 49 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3-tesla MRI scanning, and hippocampal subfield volumes were measured and compared. Additionally, we explored the correlation pattern between hippocampal subfield volumes and the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD-K) neuropsychological test scores in aMCI subjects. Subjects with aMCI exhibited significant hippocampal volume reductions in the presubiculum, subiculum and cornu ammonis 2-3 areas compared with healthy subjects. In addition, we also found significant positive correlations between presubiculum and subicular area volumes and the CERAD-K verbal and visuospatial delayed recall scores in aMCI. This study was the first to explore the relationships between hippocampal subfield volumes and various types of cognitive performances in aMCI. These structural changes might be at the core of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction in aMCI.},

However, empirical data for the role of the hippocampus in pattern separation have not been available until recently. This review summarizes data from electrophysiological recordings, lesion studies, immediate-early gene imaging, transgenic mouse models, as well as human functional neuroimaging, that provide convergent evidence for the involvement of particular hippocampal subfields in this key process. We discuss the impact of aging and adult neurogenesis on pattern separation, and also highlight several challenges to linking across species and approaches, and suggest future directions for investigation.},

	Abstract = {Dual process theories of recognition memory posit that recollection and familiarity represent dissociable processes. Animal studies and human functional imaging experiments support an anatomic dissociation of these processes in the medial temporal lobes (MTL). By this hypothesis, recollection may be dependent on the hippocampus, while familiarity appears to rely on extrahippocampal MTL (ehMTL) structures, particularly perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortices. Despite these findings, the dual process model and these anatomic mappings remain controversial, in part because the study of patients with lesions to the MTL has been limited and has revealed predominantly single dissociations. We examined measures of recollection and familiarity in three groups (normal older adults, amnesic-mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease) in which these memory measures and the relative integrity of MTL structures are variable, thus enhancing our power to detect MTL-memory relationships. Recollection and familiarity and volumes of hippocampus and ehMTL, defined as a region including entorhinal/perirhinal cortices and parahippocampus, were measured. Regression analyses revealed a stronger relationship of recollection with the hippocampus compared to ehMTL, while familiarity was more highly related to ehMTL compared to hippocampus. These results are consistent with a division of labor in the MTL and the dual process model.},

This preliminary study suggests that excess CA1 and subicular atrophy is present in cognitively normal individuals predestined to decline to amnestic MCI, while progressive involvement of the CA1 and subiculum, and atrophy spreading to the CA2-3 subfield in amnestic MCI, suggests future diagnosis of AD.},

	Abstract = {The perirhinal cortex (Brodmann's area 35) is a multimodal area that is important for normal memory function. Specifically, perirhinal cortex is involved in the detection of novel objects and manifests neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease very early in disease progression. We scanned ex vivo brain hemispheres at standard resolution (1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm) to construct pial/white matter surfaces in FreeSurfer and scanned again at high resolution (120 μm × 120 μm × 120 μm) to determine cortical architectural boundaries. After labeling perirhinal area 35 in the high resolution images, we mapped the high resolution labels to the surface models to localize area 35 in fourteen cases. We validated the area boundaries determined using histological Nissl staining. To test the accuracy of the probabilistic mapping, we measured the Hausdorff distance between the predicted and true labels and found that the median Hausdorff distance was 4.0mm for the left hemispheres (n=7) and 3.2mm for the right hemispheres (n=7) across subjects. To show the utility of perirhinal localization, we mapped our labels to a subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and found decreased cortical thickness measures in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease compared to controls in the predicted perirhinal area 35. Our ex vivo probabilistic mapping of the perirhinal cortex provides histologically validated, automated and accurate labeling of architectonic regions in the medial temporal lobe, and facilitates the analysis of atrophic changes in a large dataset for earlier detection and diagnosis.},

	Abstract = {There is great interest in the cognitive consequences of hippocampal volume loss in developmental amnesia (DA). In many DA cases, volume loss occurs before the hippocampus is fully developed, and yet little is known about the locus, extent, and distribution of damage in these cases. We used high-resolution MRI to manually segment the medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions in H.C., an adult with DA, and a group of sex-, age- and education-matched control participants (n = 10). The hippocampus was defined and divided into anterior (head) and posterior (body and tail) segments. Within the body of the hippocampus, the subregions (CA1 , DG/CA2/3 , and subiculum) were defined. Finally, the entorhinal (ERC), perirhinal (PRC), and parahippocampal (PHC) cortices were segmented. Anterior hippocampus was reduced bilaterally and posterior hippocampus was significantly reduced on the right. In the body of the hippocampus, all three subregions were reduced in the left hemisphere, whereas CA1 and subiculum were reduced in the right hemisphere. No group differences were observed in the PRC and ERC, whereas left PHC volume was marginally increased in H.C. compared to controls. These results can be used to inform patterns of spared and impaired cognitive abilities in DA and perhaps in amnesia more generally. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

Given how difficult it is to label brains, the Mindboggle-101 dataset is intended to serve as brain atlases for use in labeling other brains, as a normative dataset to establish morphometric variation in a healthy population for comparison against clinical populations, and contribute to the development, training, testing, and evaluation of automated registration and labeling algorithms.

@article{winterburn13,
	Abstract = {The hippocampus is a neuroanatomical structure that has been widely studied in the context of learning, memory, stress, and neurodegeneration. Neuroanatomically, the hippocampus is subdivided into several subfields with intricate morphologies and complex three-dimensional relationships. Recent studies have demonstrated that the identification of different subfields is possible with high-resolution and -contrast image volumes acquired using ex vivo specimens in a small bore 9.4 T scanner and, more recently, in vivo, at 7 T. In these studies, the neuroanatomical definitions of boundaries between subfields are based upon salient differences in image contrast. Typically, the definition of subfields has not been possible using commonly available magnetic resonance (MR) scanners (i.e.: 1.5 or 3T) due to resolution and contrast limitations. To overcome the limited availability of post-mortem specimens and expertise in state-of-the-art high-field imaging, we propose a coupling of MR acquisition and detailed segmentation techniques that allow for the reliable identification of hippocampal anatomy (including subfields). High-resolution and -contrast T1- and T2-weighted image volumes were acquired from 5 volunteers (2 male; 3 female; age range: 29-57, avg. 37) using a clinical research-grade 3T scanner and have final super-sampled isotropic voxel dimensions of 0.3mm. We demonstrate that by using these acquisition techniques, our data results in contrast-to-noise ratios that compare well with high-resolution images acquired with long scan times using post-mortem data at higher field strengths. For the subfields, the cornus ammonis (CA) 1, CA2/CA3, CA4/dentate gyrus, stratum radiatum/stratum lacunosum/stratum moleculare, and subiculum were all labeled as separate structures. Hippocampal volumes are reported for each of the substructures and the hippocampus as a whole (range for hippocampus: 2456.72-3325.02 mm(3)). Intra-rater reliability of our manual segmentation protocol demonstrates high reliability for the whole hippocampus (mean Dice Kappa of 0.91; range 0.90-0.92) and for each of the subfields (range of Dice Kappas: 0.64-0.83). We demonstrate that our reliability is better than the Dice Kappas produced by simulating the following errors: a translation by a single voxel in all cardinal directions and 1% volumetric shrinkage and expansion. The completed hippocampal atlases are available freely online (info2.camh.net/kf-tigr/index.php/Hippocampus) and can be coupled with novel computational neuroanatomy techniques that will allow for them to be customized to the unique neuroanatomy of different subjects, and ultimately be utilized in different analysis pipelines.},

	Abstract = {Probabilistic maps of neocortical areas and subcortical fiber tracts, warped to a common reference brain, have been published using microscopic architectonic parcellations in ten human postmortem brains. The maps have been successfully applied as topographical references for the anatomical localization of activations observed in functional imaging studies. Here, for the first time, we present stereotaxic, probabilistic maps of the hippocampus, the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex and some of their subdivisions. Cytoarchitectonic mapping was performed in serial, cell-body stained histological sections. The positions and the extent of cytoarchitectonically defined structures were traced in digitized histological sections, 3-D reconstructed and warped to the reference space of the MNI single subject brain using both linear and non-linear elastic tools of alignment. The probability maps and volumes of all structures were calculated. The precise localization of the borders of the mapped regions cannot be predicted consistently by macroanatomical landmarks. Many borders, e.g. between the subiculum and entorhinal cortex, subiculum and Cornu ammonis, and amygdala and hippocampus, do not match sulcal landmarks such as the bottom of a sulcus. Only microscopic observation enables the precise localization of the borders of these brain regions. The superposition of the cytoarchitectonic maps in the common spatial reference system shows a considerably lower degree of intersubject variability in size and position of the allocortical structures and nuclei than the previously delineated neocortical areas. For the first time, the present observations provide cytoarchitectonically verified maps of the human amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which take into account the stereotaxic position of the brain structures as well as intersubject variability. We believe that these maps are efficient tools for the precise microstructural localization of fMRI, PET and anatomical MR data, both in healthy and pathologically altered brains.},

	Abstract = {Measures of overlap of labelled regions of images, such as the Dice and Tanimoto coefficients, have been extensively used to evaluate image registration and segmentation algorithms. Modern studies can include multiple labels defined on multiple images yet most evaluation schemes report one overlap per labelled region, simply averaged over multiple images. In this paper, common overlap measures are generalized to measure the total overlap of ensembles of labels defined on multiple test images and account for fractional labels using fuzzy set theory. This framework allows a single "figure-of-merit" to be reported which summarises the results of a complex experiment by image pair, by label or overall. A complementary measure of error, the overlap distance, is defined which captures the spatial extent of the nonoverlapping part and is related to the Hausdorff distance computed on grey level images. The generalized overlap measures are validated on synthetic images for which the overlap can be computed analytically and used as similarity measures in nonrigid registration of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain images. Finally, a pragmatic segmentation ground truth is constructed by registering a magnetic resonance atlas brain to 20 individual scans, and used with the overlap measures to evaluate publicly available brain segmentation algorithms.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is often a difficult structure to visualize with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) due to its convoluted nature and susceptibility to signal dropout. Improving our ability to pinpoint changes in neural activity using fMRI in this structure remains an important challenge. Current fMRI/MRI methods typically do not permit visualization of the hippocampus and surrounding cortex at a resolution less than 1 mm. We present here improvements to our previous methods for obtaining structural MR images of the hippocampus, which provided an in-plane resolution of 0.4 mm(2) mm and two-dimensional "flat" maps of the hippocampus with an interpolated isotropic resolution of 0.4 mm(3) (Engel, S.A., Glover, G.H., and Wandell, B.A., (1997). Retinotopic organization in human visual cortex and the spatial precision of functional MRI. Cereb. Cortex 7, 181-192.; Zeineh, M.M., Engel, S.A., and Bookheimer, S.Y., (2000). Application of cortical unfolding techniques to functional MRI of the human hippocampal region. NeuroImage 11, 668-683.). We present changes to existing structural imaging sequences that now augment the resolution of previous scans, permitting visualization of the anterior portion of CA1, parts of the dentate gyrus, and CA23. These imaging improvements are of relevance generally to the field of imaging because they permit higher overall resolution imaging of the hippocampus than previously possible (at 3 T). We also introduce a novel application of a computational interpolation method that improves our ability to capture the convoluted three-dimensional shape of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we have developed a quantitative method for obtaining group activation patterns based on producing averaged flat maps using vector field warping techniques, allowing localization of activations to specific hippocampal subregions across groups of subjects. Together, these methods provide a means to improve imaging of neural activity in the human hippocampus and surrounding cortex during cognitive tasks.},

	Abstract = {The concept of cognitive impairment intervening between normal ageing and very early dementia has been in the literature for many years. Recently, the construct of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been proposed to designate an early, but abnormal, state of cognitive impairment. MCI has generated a great deal of research from both clinical and research perspectives. Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the accelerated rate of progression to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in MCI subjects and certain predictor variables appear valid. However, there has been controversy regarding the precise definition of the concept and its implementation in various clinical settings. Clinical subtypes of MCI have been proposed to broaden the concept and include prodromal forms of a variety of dementias. It is suggested that the diagnosis of MCI can be made in a fashion similar to the clinical diagnoses of dementia and AD. An algorithm is presented to assist the clinician in identifying subjects and subclassifying them into the various types of MCI. By refining the criteria for MCI, clinical trials can be designed with appropriate inclusion and exclusion restrictions to allow for the investigation of therapeutics tailored for specific targets and populations.},

Computational models have stressed the role of the hippocampus and, in particular, the dentate gyrus and its projections into the CA3 subregion in pattern separation. We used high-resolution (1.5-millimeter isotropic voxels) functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during incidental memory encoding. Although activity consistent with a bias toward pattern completion was observed in CA1, the subiculum, and the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, activity consistent with a strong bias toward pattern separation was observed in, and limited to, the CA3/dentate gyrus. These results provide compelling evidence of a key role of the human CA3/dentate gyrus in pattern separation.},

	Abstract = {This review introduces a novel deformable image registration paradigm that exploits Markov random field formulation and powerful discrete optimization algorithms. We express deformable registration as a minimal cost graph problem, where nodes correspond to the deformation grid, a node's connectivity corresponds to regularization constraints, and labels correspond to 3D deformations. To cope with both iconic and geometric (landmark-based) registration, we introduce two graphical models, one for each subproblem. The two graphs share interconnected variables, leading to a modular, powerful, and flexible formulation that can account for arbitrary image-matching criteria, various local deformation models, and regularization constraints. To cope with the corresponding optimization problem, we adopt two optimization strategies: a computationally efficient one and a tight relaxation alternative. Promising results demonstrate the potential of this approach. Discrete methods are an important new trend in medical image registration, as they provide several improvements over the more traditional continuous methods. This is illustrated with several key examples where the presented framework outperforms existing general-purpose registration methods in terms of both performance and computational complexity. Our methods become of particular interest in applications where computation time is a critical issue, as in intraoperative imaging, or where the huge variation in data demands complex and application-specific matching criteria, as in large-scale multimodal population studies. The proposed registration framework, along with a graphical interface and corresponding publications, is available for download for research purposes (for Windows and Linux platforms) from http://www.mrf-registration.net.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of segmenting an image into regions. We define a predicate for measuring the evidence for a boundary between two regions using a graph-based representation of the image. We then develop an efficient segmentation algorithm based on this predicate, and show that although this algorithm makes greedy decisions it produces segmentations that satisfy global properties. We apply the algorithm to image segmentation using two different kinds of local neighborhoods in constructing the graph, and illustrate the results with both real and synthetic images. The algorithm runs in time nearly linear in the number of graph edges and is also fast in practice. An important characteristic of the method is its ability to preserve detail in low-variability image regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although a few automated hippocampal subfield segmentation methods have been developed, there is no study on the effects of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease on the hippocampal subfield volume with in vivo MR imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate hippocampal subfield volume differences between drug-na{\"\i}ve subjects with AD and healthy elderly controls by using an automated hippocampal subfield segmentation technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one drug-na{\"\i}ve subjects with AD and 33 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3T MR imaging, and hippocampal subfield volume was measured and compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Subjects with AD had significantly smaller volumes of the presubiculum, subiculum, CA2-3, and CA4 DG compared with healthy subjects (uncorrected, P < .001). In addition, we found significant positive correlations between the presubiculum and the subicular volumes and the MMSE-K and the CERAD-K verbal delayed recall scores in the AD group.
CONCLUSIONS: We are unaware of previous imaging studies of automated hippocampal subfield segmentation in AD. These structural changes in the hippocampal presubiculum, subiculum, and CA2-3 might be at the core of underlying neurobiologic mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction and their relevance to verbal delayed recall impairments in AD.},

	Abstract = {Here, we describe a novel method for volumetric segmentation of the amygdala from MRI images collected from 35 human subjects. This approach is adapted from open-source techniques employed previously with the hippocampus (Suh et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011a,b). Using multi-atlas segmentation and machine learning-based correction, we were able to produce automated amygdala segments with high Dice (Mean = 0.918 for the left amygdala; 0.916 for the right amygdala) and Jaccard coefficients (Mean = 0.850 for the left; 0.846 for the right) compared to rigorously hand-traced volumes. This automated routine also produced amygdala segments with high intra-class correlations (consistency = 0.830, absolute agreement = 0.819 for the left; consistency = 0.786, absolute agreement = 0.783 for the right) and bivariate (r = 0.831 for the left; r = 0.797 for the right) compared to hand-drawn amygdala. Our results are discussed in relation to other cutting-edge segmentation techniques, as well as commonly available approaches to amygdala segmentation (e.g., Freesurfer). We believe this new technique has broad application to research with large sample sizes for which amygdala quantification might be needed.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative tractography may provide insights into regional heterogeneity of changes in white matter structure in normal ageing. Here we examine how brain atrophy and white matter lesions affect correlations between tract shape, tract integrity and age in a range of frontal and non-frontal tracts in 90 non-demented subjects aged over 65 years using an enhanced version of probabilistic neighbourhood tractography. This novel method for automatic single seed point placement employs unsupervised learning and streamline selection to provide reliable and accurate tract segmentation, whilst also indicating how the shape of an individual tract compares to that of a predefined reference tract. There were significant negative correlations between tract shape similarity to reference tracts derived from a young brain white matter atlas and age in genu and splenium of corpus callosum. Controlling for intracranial and lateral ventricle volume, the latter of which increased significantly with age, attenuated these correlations by 40% and 84%, respectively, indicating that this age-related change in callosal tract topology is significantly mediated by global atrophy and ventricular enlargement. In accordance with the "frontal ageing" hypothesis, there was a significant positive correlation between mean diffusivity (D) and age, and a significant negative correlation between fractional anisotropy (FA) and age in corpus callosum genu; correlations not seen in splenium. Significant positive correlations were also observed between D and age in bilateral cingulum cingulate gyri, uncinate fasciculi and right corticospinal tract. This pattern of correlations was not, however, reproduced when those subjects with significant white matter lesion load were analyzed separately from those without. These data therefore suggest that brain atrophy and white matter lesions play a significant role in driving regional patterns of age-related changes in white matter tract shape and integrity.},

@article{hayasaka04,
	Abstract = {In a massively univariate analysis of brain image data, statistical inference is typically based on intensity or spatial extent of signals. Voxel intensity-based tests provide great sensitivity for high intensity signals, whereas cluster extent-based tests are sensitive to spatially extended signals. To benefit from the strength of both, the intensity and extent information needs to be combined. Various ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent are possible, and a few such combining methods have been proposed. Poline et al.'s [NeuroImage 16 (1997) 83] minimum P value approach is sensitive to signals whose either intensity or extent is significant. Bullmore et al.'s [IEEE Trans. Med. Imag. 18 (1999) 32] cluster mass method can detect signals whose intensity and extent are sufficiently large, even when they are not significant by intensity or extent alone. In this work, we study such combined inference methods using combining functions (Pesarin, F., 2001. Multivariate Permutation Tests. Wiley, New York) and permutation framework [Holmes et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 16 (1996) 7], which allow us to examine different ways of combining voxel intensity and cluster extent information without knowing their distribution. We also attempt to calibrate combined inference by using weighted combining functions, which adjust the test according to signals of interest. Furthermore, we propose meta-combining, a combining function of combining functions, which integrates strengths of multiple combining functions into a single statistic. We found that combined tests are able to detect signals that are not detected by voxel or cluster size test alone. We also found that the weighted combining functions can calibrate the combined test according to the signals of interest, emphasizing either intensity or extent as appropriate. Though not necessarily more sensitive than individual combining functions, the meta-combining function is sensitive to all types of signals and thus can be used as a single test summarizing all the combining functions.},

	Abstract = {The cortex is the outermost thin layer of gray matter in the brain; geometric measurement of the cortex helps in understanding brain anatomy and function. In the quantitative analysis of the cortex from MR images, extracting the structure and obtaining a representation for various measurements are key steps. While manual segmentation is tedious and labor intensive, automatic reliable efficient segmentation and measurement of the cortex remain challenging problems, due to its convoluted nature. Here we present a new approach of coupled-surfaces propagation, using level set methods to address such problems. Our method is motivated by the nearly constant thickness of the cortical mantle and takes this tight coupling as an important constraint. By evolving two embedded surfaces simultaneously, each driven by its own image-derived information while maintaining the coupling, a final representation of the cortical bounding surfaces and an automatic segmentation of the cortex are achieved. Characteristics of the cortex, such as cortical surface area, surface curvature, and cortical thickness, are then evaluated. The level set implementation of surface propagation offers the advantage of easy initialization, computational efficiency, and the ability to capture deep sulcal folds. Results and validation from various experiments on both simulated and real three-dimensional (3-D) MR images are provided.},

	Abstract = {The in vivo investigation of joint kinematics in normal and injured wrist requires the segmentation of carpal bones from 3D (CT) images, and their registration over time. The non-uniformity of bone tissue, ranging from dense cortical bone to textured spongy bone, the irregular shape of closely packed carpal bones, small inter-bone spaces compared to the resolution of CT images, along with the presence of blood vessels, and the inherent blurring of CT imaging render the segmentation of carpal bones a challenging task. We review the performance of statistical classification, deformable models (active contours), region growing, region competition, and morphological operations for this application. We then propose a model which combines several of these approaches in a unified framework. Specifically, our approach is to use a curve evolution implementation of region growing from initialized seeds, where growth is modulated by a skeletally-mediated competition between neighboring regions. The inter-seed skeleton, which we interpret as the predicted boundary of collision between two regions, is used to couple the growth of seeds and to mediate long-range competition between them. The implementation requires subpixel representations of each growing region as well as the inter-region skeleton. This method combines the advantages of active contour models, region growing, and both local and global region competition methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for our application where many of the difficulties presented above are overcome as illustrated by synthetic and real examples. Since this segmentation method does not rely on domain-specific knowledge, it should be applicable to a range of other medical imaging segmentation tasks.},

	Abstract = {Assessment of long-term outcomes is essential in brain surgery for epilepsy, which is an irreversible intervention for a chronic condition. Excellent short-term results of resective epilepsy surgery have been established, but less is known about long-term outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence on this topic. To provide evidence-based estimates of long-term results of various types of epilepsy surgery and to identify sources of variation in results of published studies, we searched Medline, Index Medicus, the Cochrane database, bibliographies of reviews, original articles and book chapters to identify articles published since 1991 that contained > or =20 patients of any age, undergoing resective or non-resective epilepsy surgery, and followed for a mean/median of > or =5 years. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data, resolving disagreements through discussion. Seventy-six articles fulfilled our eligibility criteria, of which 71 reported on resective surgery (93%) and five (7%) on non-resective surgery. There were no randomized trials and only six studies had a control group. Some articles contributed more than one study, yielding 83 studies of which 78 dealt with resective surgery and five with non-resective surgery. Forty studies (51%) of resective surgery referred to temporal lobe surgery, 25 (32%) to grouped temporal and extratemporal surgery, seven (9%) to frontal surgery, two (3%) to grouped extratemporal surgery, two (3%) to hemispherectomy, and one (1%) each to parietal and occipital surgery. In the non-resective category, three studies reported outcomes after callosotomy and two after multiple subpial transections. The median proportion of long-term seizure-free patients was 66% with temporal lobe resections, 46% with occipital and parietal resections, and 27% with frontal lobe resections. In the long term, only 35% of patients with callosotomy were free of most disabling seizures, and 16% with multiple subpial transections remained free of all seizures. The year of operation, duration of follow-up and outcome classification system were most strongly associated with outcomes. Almost all long-term outcome studies describe patient cohorts without controls. Although there is substantial variation in outcome definition and methodology among the studies, consistent patterns of results emerge for various surgical interventions after adjusting for sources of heterogeneity. The long-term (> or =5 years) seizure free rate following temporal lobe resective surgery was similar to that reported in short-term controlled studies. On the other hand, long-term seizure freedom was consistently lower after extratemporal surgery and palliative procedures.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use serial imaging to gain insight into the sequence of pathologic events in Alzheimer's disease, and the clinical features associated with this sequence. We measured change in amyloid deposition over time using serial (11)C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography and progression of neurodegeneration using serial structural magnetic resonance imaging. We studied 21 healthy cognitively normal subjects, 32 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 8 with Alzheimer's disease. Subjects were drawn from two sources--ongoing longitudinal registries at Mayo Clinic, and the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). All subjects underwent clinical assessments, MRI and PIB studies at two time points, approximately one year apart. PIB retention was quantified in global cortical to cerebellar ratio units and brain atrophy in units of cm(3) by measuring ventricular expansion. The annual change in global PIB retention did not differ by clinical group (P = 0.90), and although small (median 0.042 ratio units/year overall) was greater than zero among all subjects (P < 0.001). Ventricular expansion rates differed by clinical group (P < 0.001) and increased in the following order: cognitively normal (1.3 cm(3)/year) < amnestic mild cognitive impairment (2.5 cm(3)/year) < Alzheimer's disease (7.7 cm(3)/year). Among all subjects there was no correlation between PIB change and concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = -0.01, P = 0.97) but some evidence of a weak correlation with MMSE (r =-0.22, P = 0.09). In contrast, greater rates of ventricular expansion were clearly correlated with worsening concurrent change on CDR-SB (r = 0.42, P < 0.01) and MMSE (r =-0.52, P < 0.01). Our data are consistent with a model of typical late onset Alzheimer's disease that has two main features: (i) dissociation between the rate of amyloid deposition and the rate of neurodegeneration late in life, with amyloid deposition proceeding at a constant slow rate while neurodegeneration accelerates and (ii) clinical symptoms are coupled to neurodegeneration not amyloid deposition. Significant plaque deposition occurs prior to clinical decline. The presence of brain amyloidosis alone is not sufficient to produce cognitive decline, rather, the neurodegenerative component of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the direct substrate of cognitive impairment and the rate of cognitive decline is driven by the rate of neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration (atrophy on MRI) both precedes and parallels cognitive decline. This model implies a complimentary role for MRI and PIB imaging in Alzheimer's disease, with each reflecting one of the major pathologies, amyloid dysmetabolism and neurodegeneration.},

Biomarkers are needed to monitor drug safety, to identify individuals who are most likely to respond to specific treatments, to stratify presymptomatic patients and to quantify the benefits of treatments.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the ability of fully automated volumetric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to depict hippocampal atrophy (HA) and to help correctly lateralize the seizure focus in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted with institutional review board approval and in compliance with HIPAA regulations. Volumetric MR imaging data were analyzed for 34 patients with TLE and 116 control subjects. Structural volumes were calculated by using U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared software for automated quantitative MR imaging analysis (NeuroQuant). Results of quantitative MR imaging were compared with visual detection of atrophy, and, when available, with histologic specimens. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to determine the optimal sensitivity and specificity of quantitative MR imaging for detecting HA and asymmetry. A linear classifier with cross validation was used to estimate the ability of quantitative MR imaging to help lateralize the seizure focus.
RESULTS: Quantitative MR imaging-derived hippocampal asymmetries discriminated patients with TLE from control subjects with high sensitivity (86.7%-89.5%) and specificity (92.2%-94.1%). When a linear classifier was used to discriminate left versus right TLE, hippocampal asymmetry achieved 94% classification accuracy. Volumetric asymmetries of other subcortical structures did not improve classification. Compared with invasive video electroencephalographic recordings, lateralization accuracy was 88% with quantitative MR imaging and 85% with visual inspection of volumetric MR imaging studies but only 76% with visual inspection of clinical MR imaging studies.
CONCLUSION: Quantitative MR imaging can depict the presence and laterality of HA in TLE with accuracy rates that may exceed those achieved with visual inspection of clinical MR imaging studies. Thus, quantitative MR imaging may enhance standard visual analysis, providing a useful and viable means for translating volumetric analysis into clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {In the study of brain morphometry, it is accepted that a relationship exists between brain structure and function, both normal and abnormal. One descriptor of morphometric structure is volume. Abnormalities in hippocampal morphology, including unilateral or bilateral volume loss, are known to occur in epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and in certain amnestic syndromes. Precise quantitation should improve understanding of the role of any biologic system in normal function and in disease. The objectives of magnetic resonance (MR)-based hippocampal volume measurements are precise quantitation, identification of a normal range, and identification of the association between biologic variables and aberrations in this volumetric parameter. Volumetric measures introduce a level of precision in the estimation of hippocampal size that is not available simply by visually inspecting a set of MR images, thus enabling statistically based hypothesis testing. To produce accurate hippocampal volume measurements with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), attention must be directed to the two major components of the operation as a whole, MR image acquisition and image processing.},

	Abstract = {Measurement of hippocampal volume by MRI is a new technique with potential value in the localization of epileptic regions, but whether reduced hippocampal volume predicts the location of electrical seizure onset in mixed patient groups is not known. We examined the sensitivity and specificity of this technique among 56 refractory epileptic patients for the diagnosis of medial temporal lobe epilepsy as judged by intracranial EEG recording of spontaneous seizure onset. Since these patients had intracranial EEG because of inconsistent or insufficient localization by noninvasive electrophysiologic, functional, and structural assessment, this patient population can be considered the most difficult to localize. Hippocampal atrophy by MRI volumetry was 75% sensitive to, and 64% specific for, ipsilateral medial temporal lobe seizure onset in this group. Hippocampal atrophy was significantly correlated with longer duration of epilepsy. MRI compared favorably with all other noninvasive means of localization, which had 41 to 73% sensitivity and 45 to 65% specificity to medial temporal ictal onset; of these, none had as acceptable a combination of both adequate sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that MRI volumetry of the hippocampus is a valuable, noninvasive localization method in chronic epilepsy, with a yield and accuracy surpassing all other noninvasive studies used to predict the presence of medial temporal seizure onset.},

	Abstract = {Despite neuropathological and electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of parahippocampal structures in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), little attention has been paid to morphometric measurements of these structures in patients with TLE. Using high resolution MRI, we previously showed that the volume of the entorhinal cortex was decreased in patients with TLE. The purpose of this study was: (i) to determine whether changes in the volume of the perirhinal cortex and posterior parahippocampal cortex were detectable by MRI; and (ii) to study the distribution and degree of atrophy in mesial temporal structures including the hippocampal head, body and tail, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex and posterior parahippocampal cortex. MRI volumetric analysis was performed using a T(1)-weighted three-dimensional gradient echo sequence in 20 healthy subjects and 25 TLE patients with intractable TLE. In patients with either left or right TLE, the hippocampal head, body and tail and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices ipsilateral to the seizure focus were significantly smaller than in normal controls. The mean volume of the posterior parahippocampal cortex was not different from that of normal controls. Within the hippocampus, the hippocampal head was more atrophic than the hippocampal body and hippocampal tail. Within the parahippocampal region, the entorhinal cortex was more severely affected than the perirhinal cortex. Our MRI results confirm pathological findings of damage in the mesial temporal lobe, involving not only the hippocampus and the amygdala, but also the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. The pattern of atrophy may be explained by cell loss secondary to a disruption of entorhinal-hippocampal connections as a result of privileged electrical dialogue between these two structures.},

@article{seidenberg05,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the presence, extent, and clinical correlates of quantitative MR volumetric abnormalities in ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus, and temporal and extratemporal lobe regions in unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
METHODS: In total, 34 subjects with unilateral left (n = 15) or right (n = 19) TLE were compared with 65 healthy controls. Regions of interest included the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus as well as temporal, frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe gray and white matter. Clinical markers of neurodevelopmental insult (initial precipitating insult, early age of recurrent seizures) and chronicity of epilepsy (epilepsy duration, estimated number of lifetime generalized seizures) were related to magnetic resonance (MR) volume abnormalities.
RESULTS: Quantitative MR abnormalities extend beyond the ipsilateral hippocampus and temporal lobe with extratemporal (frontal and parietal lobe) reductions in cerebral white matter, especially ipsilateral but also contralateral to the side of seizure onset. Volumetric abnormalities in ipsilateral hippocampus and bilateral cerebral white matter are associated with factors related to both the onset and the chronicity of the patients' epilepsy.
CONCLUSIONS: These cross-sectional findings support the view that volumetric abnormalities in chronic TLE are associated with a combination of neurodevelopmental and progressive effects, characterized by a prominent disruption in ipsilateral hippocampus and neural connectivity (i.e., white matter volume loss) that extends beyond the temporal lobe, affecting both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres.},

@article{cendes93,
	Abstract = {We performed MRI volumetric measurements of the amygdala (AM), the hippocampal formation (HF), and the anterior temporal lobe in a group of 30 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in seven patients with extratemporal lobe foci. Measurements were analyzed with a semiautomated software program and the results compared with those of normal controls and correlated with the findings of all other investigations. In particular, we compared the results with the lateralization of epileptic abnormalities in the EEG. Volumetric studies of AM and HF showed lateralization of measurable atrophy consistent with that derived from extracranial and intracranial EEG examinations. The HF volumes were more sensitive and provided a lateralization in 87%. Combined measurements of AM and HF showed lateralization in 93%, always congruent with the results of EEG lateralization. This slight but important additional improvement in discrimination justifies using AM measurements in MRI volumetric studies of mesial temporal structures. Volumetric studies combined with other currently employed noninvasive techniques may diminish the need for invasive methods of investigation in patients with TLE.},

	Abstract = {Segmenting the mitral valve during closure and throughout a cardiac cycle from four dimensional ultrasound (4DUS) is important for creation and validation of mechanical models and for improved visualization and understanding of mitral valve behavior. Current methods of segmenting the valve from 4DUS either require extensive user interaction and initialization, do not maintain the valve geometry across a cardiac cycle, or are incapable of producing a detailed coaptation line and surface. We present a method of segmenting the mitral valve annulus and leaflets from 4DUS such that a detailed, patient-specific annulus and leaflets are tracked throughout mitral valve closure, resulting in a detailed coaptation region. The method requires only the selection of two frames from a sequence indicating the start and end of valve closure and a single point near a closed valve. The annulus and leaflets are first found through direct segmentation in the appropriate frames and then by tracking the known geometry to the remaining frames. We compared the automatically segmented meshes to expert manual tracings for both a normal and diseased mitral valve, and found an average difference of 0.59 +/- 0.49 mm, which is on the order of the spatial resolution of the ultrasound volumes (0.5-1.0 mm/voxel).},

	Abstract = {As decisions in cardiology increasingly rely on noninvasive methods, fast and precise image processing tools have become a crucial component of the analysis workflow. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first automatic system for patient-specific modeling and quantification of the left heart valves, which operates on cardiac computed tomography (CT) and transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) data. Robust algorithms, based on recent advances in discriminative learning, are used to estimate patient-specific parameters from sequences of volumes covering an entire cardiac cycle. A novel physiological model of the aortic and mitral valves is introduced, which captures complex morphologic, dynamic, and pathologic variations. This holistic representation is hierarchically defined on three abstraction levels: global location and rigid motion model, nonrigid landmark motion model, and comprehensive aortic-mitral model. First we compute the rough location and cardiac motion applying marginal space learning. The rapid and complex motion of the valves, represented by anatomical landmarks, is estimated using a novel trajectory spectrum learning algorithm. The obtained landmark model guides the fitting of the full physiological valve model, which is locally refined through learned boundary detectors. Measurements efficiently computed from the aortic-mitral representation support an effective morphological and functional clinical evaluation. Extensive experiments on a heterogeneous data set, cumulated to 1516 TEE volumes from 65 4-D TEE sequences and 690 cardiac CT volumes from 69 4-D CT sequences, demonstrated a speed of 4.8 seconds per volume and average accuracy of 1.45 mm with respect to expert defined ground-truth. Additional clinical validations prove the quantification precision to be in the range of inter-user variability. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a patient-specific model of the aortic and mitral valves is automatically estimated from volumetric sequences.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Real-time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography has the ability to construct quantitative models of the mitral valve (MV). Imaging and modeling algorithms rely on operator interpretation of raw images and may be subject to observer-dependent variability. We describe a comprehensive analysis technique to generate high-resolution 3D MV models and examine interoperator and intraoperator repeatability in humans.
METHODS: Patients with normal MVs were imaged using intraoperative transesophageal real-time 3D echocardiography. The annulus and leaflets were manually segmented using a TomTec Echo-View workstation. The resultant annular and leaflet point cloud was used to generate fully quantitative 3D MV models using custom Matlab algorithms. Eight images were subjected to analysis by two independent observers. Two sequential images were acquired for 6 patients and analyzed by the same observer. Each pair of annular tracings was compared with respect to conventional variables and by calculating the mean absolute distance between paired renderings. To compare leaflets, MV models were aligned so as to minimize their sum of squares difference, and their mean absolute difference was measured.
RESULTS: Mean absolute annular and leaflet distance was 2.4$\pm$0.8 and 0.6$\pm$0.2 mm for the interobserver and 1.5$\pm$0.6 and 0.5$\pm$0.2 mm for the intraobserver comparisons, respectively. There was less than 10% variation in annular variables between comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS: These techniques generate high-resolution, quantitative 3D models of the MV and can be used consistently to image the human MV with very small interoperator and intraoperator variability. These data lay the framework for reliable and comprehensive noninvasive modeling of the normal and diseased MV.},

In this study, we propose a novel patch-based method using expert manual segmentations as priors to achieve this task. Inspired by recent work in image denoising, the proposed nonlocal patch-based label fusion produces accurate and robust segmentation. Validation with two different datasets is presented. In our experiments, the hippocampi of 80 healthy subjects and the lateral ventricles of 80 patients with Alzheimer's disease were segmented. The influence on segmentation accuracy of different parameters such as patch size and number of training subjects was also studied. A comparison with an appearance-based method and a template-based method was also carried out. The highest median kappa index values obtained with the proposed method were 0.884 for hippocampus segmentation and 0.959 for lateral ventricle segmentation.},

	Abstract = {Assessment of temporal lobe atrophy from magnetic resonance images is a part of clinical guidelines for the diagnosis of prodromal Alzheimer's disease. As hippocampus is known to be among the first areas affected by the disease, fast and robust definition of hippocampus volume would be of great importance in the clinical decision making. We propose a method for computing automatically the volume of hippocampus using a modified multi-atlas segmentation framework, including an improved initialization of the framework and the correction of partial volume effect. The method produced a high similarity index, 0.87, and correlation coefficient, 0.94, with semi-automatically generated segmentations. When comparing hippocampus volumes extracted from 1.5T and 3T images, the absolute value of the difference was low: 3.2% of the volume. The correct classification rate for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal cases was about 80% while the accuracy 65% was obtained for classifying stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment cases. The method was evaluated in three cohorts consisting altogether about 1000 cases, the main emphasis being in the analysis of the ADNI cohort.

	Abstract = {Since hippocampal volume has been found to be an early biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, there is large interest in automated methods to accurately, robustly, and reproducibly extract the hippocampus from MRI data. In this work we present a segmentation method based on the minimization of an energy functional with intensity and prior terms, which are derived from manually labelled training images. The intensity energy is based on a statistical intensity model that is learned from the training images. The prior energy consists of a spatial and regularity term. The spatial prior is obtained from a probabilistic atlas created by registering the training images to the unlabelled target image, and deforming and averaging the training labels. The regularity prior energy encourages smooth segmentations. The resulting energy functional is globally minimized using graph cuts. The method was evaluated using image data from a population-based study on diseases among the elderly. Two set of images were used: a small set of 20 manually labelled MR images and a larger set of 498 images, for which manual volume measurements were available, but no segmentations. This data was previously used in a volumetry study that found significant associations between hippocampal volume and cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Cross-validation experiments with the labelled set showed similarity indices of 0.852 and 0.864 and mean surface distances of 0.40 and 0.36 mm for the left and right hippocampus. 83% of the automated segmentations of the large set were rated as 'good' by a trained observer. Also, the proposed method was used to repeat the manual hippocampal volumetry study. The automatically obtained hippocampal volumes showed significant associations with cognitive decline and dementia, similar to the manually measured volumes. Finally, direct quantitative and qualitative comparisons showed that the proposed method outperforms a multi-atlas based segmentation method.},

	Abstract = {With hippocampal atrophy both a clinical biomarker for early Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and implicated in many other neurological and psychiatric diseases, there is much interest in the accurate, reproducible delineation of this region of interest (ROI) in structural MR images. Here we present Fast Marching for Automated Segmentation of the Hippocampus (FMASH): a novel approach using the Sethian Fast Marching (FM) technique to grow a hippocampal ROI from an automatically-defined seed point. Segmentation performance is assessed on two separate clinical datasets, utilising expert manual labels as gold standard to quantify Dice coefficients, false positive rates (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR). The first clinical dataset (denoted CMA) contains normal controls (NC) and atrophied AD patients, whilst the second is a collection of NC and bipolar (BP) patients (denoted BPSA). An optimal and robust stopping criterion is established for the propagating FM front and the final FMASH segmentation estimates compared to two commonly-used methods: FIRST/FSL and Freesurfer (FS). Results show that FMASH outperforms both FIRST and FS on the BPSA data, with significantly higher Dice coefficients (0.80$\pm$0.01) and lower FPR. Despite some intrinsic bias for FIRST and FS on the CMA data, due to their training, FMASH performs comparably well on the CMA data, with an average bilateral Dice coefficient of 0.82$\pm$0.01. Furthermore, FMASH most accurately captures the hippocampal volume difference between NC and AD, and provides a more accurate estimation of the problematic hippocampus-amygdala border on both clinical datasets. The consistency in performance across the two datasets suggests that FMASH is applicable to a range of clinical data with differing image quality and demographics.},

@article{schott05,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global brain atrophy rate calculated from serial MRI scans may be a surrogate marker of Alzheimer disease (AD) progression. Few studies have assessed atrophy in AD over short intervals.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with AD and 19 control subjects had MRI scans at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year. Ventricular change and whole-brain volume loss were calculated directly from the regions manually outlined on registered scans and using the automated (boundary shift integral [BSI]) technique. Sample sizes required to power placebo-controlled treatment trials over 6 months and 1 year were calculated using these techniques.
RESULTS: Increased rates of ventricular expansion and whole-brain atrophy were seen in AD compared with control subjects at both 6 and 12 months using manual and automated techniques (p < 0.001). Using the BSI consistently reduced measurement variability especially for whole-brain change. In clinical trials, at 6 months, significantly fewer patients would be required using the ventricular BSI (VBSI) compared with the brain BSI (BBSI) (e.g., 165 vs 410 per arm to provide 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in rate of change). At 1 year, sample size estimates were smaller than at 6 months, and the advantage of using VBSI instead of BBSI was less marked.
CONCLUSIONS: In short-interval studies, using the ventricular boundary shift integral instead of the brain boundary shift integral may allow for disease-modifying effects to be demonstrated using significantly smaller sample sizes. This potential benefit must be balanced against the possibility that ventricular volumes may be more likely to be affected by factors other than neurodegeneration.},

	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm for reliable, unbiased, multivariate longitudinal analysis of cortical and white matter atrophy rates with penalized statistical methods. The pipeline uses a step-wise approach to transform and personalize template information first to a single-subject template (SST) and then to the individual's time series data. The first stream of information flows from group template to the SST; the second flows from the SST to the individual time-points and provides unbiased, prior-based segmentation and measurement of cortical thickness. MRI-bias correction, consistent longitudinal segmentation, cortical parcellation and cortical thickness estimation are all based on strong use of the subject-specific priors built from initial diffeomorphic mapping between the SST and optimal group template. We evaluate our approach with both test-retest data and with application to a driving biological problem. We use test-retest data to show that this approach produces (a) zero change when the retest data contains the same image content as the test data and (b) produces normally distributed, low variance estimates of thickness change centered at zero when test-retest data is collected near in time to test data. We also show that our approach--when combined with sparse canonical correlation analysis--reveals plausible, significant, annualized decline in cortical thickness and white matter volume when contrasting frontotemporal dementia and normal aging.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampal formation (HF) is a brain structure of great interest because of its central role in learning and memory, and its associated vulnerability to several neurological disorders. In vivo oblique coronal T2-weighted MRI with high in-plane resolution (~0.5 mm × 0.5 mm), thick slices (~2.0 mm), and a field of view tailored to imaging the hippocampal formation (denoted HF-MRI in this paper) has been advanced as a useful imaging modality for detailed hippocampal morphometry. Cross-sectional analysis of volume measurements derived from HF-MRI has shown the modality's promise to yield sensitive imaging-based biomarker for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the utility of this modality for making measurements of longitudinal change has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, using an unbiased deformation-based morphometry (DBM) pipeline, we examine the suitability of HF-MRI for estimating longitudinal change by comparing atrophy rates measured in the whole hippocampus from this modality with those measured from more common isotropic (~1 mm³) T1-weighted MRI in the same set of individuals, in a cohort of healthy controls and patients with cognitive impairment. While measurements obtained from HF-MRI were largely consistent with those obtained from T1-MRI, HF-MRI yielded slightly larger group effect of greater atrophy rates in patients than in controls. The estimated minimum sample size required for detecting a 25% change in patients' atrophy rate in the hippocampus compared to the control group with a statistical power β=0.8 was N=269. For T1-MRI, the equivalent sample size was N=325. Using a dataset of test-retest scans, we show that the measurements were free of additive bias. We also demonstrate that these results were not a confound of certain methodological choices made in the DBM pipeline to address the challenges of making longitudinal measurements from HF-MRI, using a region of interest (ROI) around the HF to globally align serial images, followed by slice-by-slice deformable registration to measure local volume change. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of atrophy rate measurements within hippocampal subfields using HF-MRI. Cross-sectional differences in atrophy rates were detected in several subfields.},

@article{pouch12medphys,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Precise 3D modeling of the mitral valve has the potential to improve our understanding of valve morphology, particularly in the setting of mitral regurgitation (MR). Toward this goal, the authors have developed a user-initialized algorithm for reconstructing valve geometry from transesophageal 3D ultrasound (3D US) image data.
METHODS: Semi-automated image analysis was performed on transesophageal 3D US images obtained from 14 subjects with MR ranging from trace to severe. Image analysis of the mitral valve at midsystole had two stages: user-initialized segmentation and 3D deformable modeling with continuous medial representation (cm-rep). Semi-automated segmentation began with user-identification of valve location in 2D projection images generated from 3D US data. The mitral leaflets were then automatically segmented in 3D using the level set method. Second, a bileaflet deformable medial model was fitted to the binary valve segmentation by Bayesian optimization. The resulting cm-rep provided a visual reconstruction of the mitral valve, from which localized measurements of valve morphology were automatically derived. The features extracted from the fitted cm-rep included annular area, annular circumference, annular height, intercommissural width, septolateral length, total tenting volume, and percent anterior tenting volume. These measurements were compared to those obtained by expert manual tracing. Regurgitant orifice area (ROA) measurements were compared to qualitative assessments of MR severity. The accuracy of valve shape representation with cm-rep was evaluated in terms of the Dice overlap between the fitted cm-rep and its target segmentation.
RESULTS: The morphological features and anatomic ROA derived from semi-automated image analysis were consistent with manual tracing of 3D US image data and with qualitative assessments of MR severity made on clinical radiology. The fitted cm-reps accurately captured valve shape and demonstrated patient-specific differences in valve morphology among subjects with varying degrees of MR severity. Minimal variation in the Dice overlap and morphological measurements was observed when different cm-rep templates were used to initialize model fitting.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the use of deformable medial modeling for semi-automated 3D reconstruction of mitral valve geometry using transesophageal 3D US. The proposed algorithm provides a parametric geometrical representation of the mitral leaflets, which can be used to evaluate valve morphology in clinical ultrasound images.},

	Abstract = {Multi-atlas segmentation is an effective approach for automatically labeling objects of interest in biomedical images. In this approach, multiple expert-segmented example images, called \emph{atlases}, are registered to a target image, and deformed atlas segmentations are combined using \emph{label fusion}. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity have been particularly successful. However, one limitation of these strategies is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this limitation, we propose a new solution for the label fusion problem, in which weighted voting is formulated in terms of minimizing the total expectation of labeling error, and in which pairwise dependency between atlases is explicitly modeled as the joint probability of two atlases making a segmentation error at a voxel. This probability is approximated using intensity similarity between a pair of atlases and the target image in the neighborhood of each voxel. We validate our method in two medical image segmentation problems: hippocampus segmentation and hippocampus subfield segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR) images. For both problems, we show consistent and significant improvement over label fusion strategies that assign atlas weights independently.},

	Abstract = {Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their associated indices are valuable tools for the assessment of the accuracy of diagnostic tests. The area under the ROC curve is a popular summary measure of the accuracy of a test. The full area under the ROC curve, however, has been criticized because it gives equal weight to all false positive error rates. Alternative indices include the area under the ROC curve in a particular range of false positive rates ('partial' area) and the sensitivity of the test for a single fixed false positive rate (FPR). We present a unified approach for computing sample size for binormal ROC curves and their indices. Our method uses Taylor series expansions to derive approximate large-sample estimates of the variance and covariance of binormal ROC curve parameters. Several examples from diagnostic radiology illustrate the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {To be diagnostically useful, structural MRI must reliably distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal aging in individual scans. Recent advances in statistical learning theory have led to the application of support vector machines to MRI for detection of a variety of disease states. The aims of this study were to assess how successfully support vector machines assigned individual diagnoses and to determine whether data-sets combined from multiple scanners and different centres could be used to obtain effective classification of scans. We used linear support vector machines to classify the grey matter segment of T1-weighted MR scans from pathologically proven AD patients and cognitively normal elderly individuals obtained from two centres with different scanning equipment. Because the clinical diagnosis of mild AD is difficult we also tested the ability of support vector machines to differentiate control scans from patients without post-mortem confirmation. Finally we sought to use these methods to differentiate scans between patients suffering from AD from those with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Up to 96% of pathologically verified AD patients were correctly classified using whole brain images. Data from different centres were successfully combined achieving comparable results from the separate analyses. Importantly, data from one centre could be used to train a support vector machine to accurately differentiate AD and normal ageing scans obtained from another centre with different subjects and different scanner equipment. Patients with mild, clinically probable AD and age/sex matched controls were correctly separated in 89% of cases which is compatible with published diagnosis rates in the best clinical centres. This method correctly assigned 89% of patients with post-mortem confirmed diagnosis of either AD or frontotemporal lobar degeneration to their respective group. Our study leads to three conclusions: Firstly, support vector machines successfully separate patients with AD from healthy aging subjects. Secondly, they perform well in the differential diagnosis of two different forms of dementia. Thirdly, the method is robust and can be generalized across different centres. This suggests an important role for computer based diagnostic image analysis for clinical practice.},

We observed that the method tends to fail when the segmentation target shows ventricular enlargement that is not captured by the atlas database. By incorporating tissue classification information into the image registration process, we aimed to increase the robustness of the method. For testing, subjects who participated in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Aging (OPTIMA) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were selected for ventriculomegaly. Segmentation quality was substantially improved in the ventricles and surrounding structures (9/9 successes on visual rating versus 4/9 successes using the baseline method). In addition, the modification resulted in a significant increase of segmentation accuracy in healthy subjects' brain images. Hippocampal segmentation results in a group of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were near identical with both approaches. The modified approach (MAPER, multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration) extends the applicability of multi-atlas based automatic whole-brain segmentation to subjects with ventriculomegaly, as seen in normal aging as well as in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.},

	Abstract = {Despite rapidly increasing interests in specific contributions of different components of human medial temporal lobe (MTL) to memory and memory impairments in normal aging and in many abnormal conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease, few modern neuroanatomical studies are available about the borders, extent, and topography of human perirhinal areas 35 and 36, which are important components of the MTL memory system. By a combined use of several cellular, neurochemical, and pathological markers, which mainly include neuronal nuclear antigen, calcium-binding proteins (parvalbumin and calbindin-D28k), nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (SMI-32), Wisteria floribunda agglutinin, and abnormally phosphorylated tau (AT8), this study has revealed that the borders of human perirhinal areas 35 and 36 are significantly different from those defined with conventional Nissl staining. In general, areas 35 and 36 occupy the ventromedial temporopolar and rhinal sulcal regions, the collateral sulcal region, and the anterior two-thirds of fusiform gyrus or occipitotemporal gyrus. Furthermore, the precise borders, extent, and topography of human areas 35 and 36 and adjoining entorhinal cortex were marked at different anteroposterior levels of the MTL with reference to variations of rhinal and collateral sulci and other useful landmarks. These findings would provide reliable neuroanatomical base for the great and yet rapidly increasing number of neuroimaging studies of the human MTL structures in healthy and many abnormal conditions.},

With the aim of fostering the use of hippocampal volume in routine clinical settings, an international task force is currently working on developing a harmonized protocol that will resolve and reduce the present heterogeneity.

	Abstract = {In drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), detecting hippocampal atrophy on MRI is crucial as it allows defining the surgical target. In addition to atrophy, about 40% of patients present with malrotation, a developmental anomaly characterized by atypical morphologies of the hippocampus and collateral sulcus. We have recently shown that both atrophy and malrotation impact negatively the performance of volume-based techniques. Here, we propose a novel hippocampal segmentation algorithm (SurfMulti) that integrates deformable parametric surfaces, vertex-wise modeling of locoregional texture and shape, and multiple templates in a unified framework. To account for inter-subject variability, including shape variants, we used a library derived from a large database of healthy (n=80) and diseased (n=288) hippocampi. To quantify malrotation, we generated 3D models from manual hippocampal labels and automatically extracted collateral sulci. The accuracy of SurfMulti was evaluated relative to manual labeling and segmentation obtained through a single atlas-based algorithm (FreeSurfer) and a volume-based multi-template approach (Vol-multi) using the Dice similarity index and surface-based shape mapping, for which we computed vertex-wise displacement vectors between automated and manual segmentations. We then correlated segmentation accuracy with malrotation features and atrophy. SurfMulti outperformed FreeSurfer and Vol-multi, and achieved a level of accuracy in TLE patients (Dice=86.9%) virtually identical to healthy controls (Dice=87.5%). Vertex-wise shape mapping showed that SurfMulti had an excellent overlap with manual labels, with sub-millimeter precision. Its performance was not influenced by atrophy or malrotation (|r|<0.20, p>0.2), while FreeSurfer (|r|>0.35, p<0.0001) and Vol-multi (|r|>0.28, p<0.05) were hampered by both anomalies. The magnitude of atrophy detected using SurfMulti was the closest to manual volumetry (Cohen's d: manual=1.71, t=7.6; SurfMulti=1.60, t=7.0; Vol-multi=1.38, t=6.1; FreeSurfer=0.91, t=3.9). The high performance of SurfMulti regardless of cohort, atrophy and shape variants identifies this algorithm as a robust segmentation tool for hippocampal volumetry.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a literature survey of automatic 3D surface registration techniques emphasizing the mathematical and algorithmic underpinnings of the subject. The relevance of surface registration to medical imaging is that there is much useful anatomical information in the form of collected surface points which originate from complimentary modalities and which must be reconciled. Surface registration can be roughly partitioned into three issues: choice of transformation, elaboration of surface representation and similarity criterion, and matching and global optimization. The first issue concerns the assumptions made about the nature of relationships between the two modalities, e.g. whether a rigid-body assumption applies, and if not, what type and how general a relation optimally maps one modality onto the other. The second issue determines what type of information we extract from the 3D surfaces, which typically characterizes their local or global shape, and how we organize this information into a representation of the surface which will lead to improved efficiency and robustness in the last stage. The last issue pertains to how we exploit this information to estimate the transformation which best aligns local primitives in a globally consistent manner or which maximizes a measure of the similarity in global shape of two surfaces. Within this framework, this paper discusses in detail each surface registration issue and reviews the state-of-the-art among existing techniques.},

	Abstract = {Koenderink characterizes the local shape of 2D surfaces in 3D in terms of the shape index and the local curvedness. The index characterizes the local type of surface point: concave, hyperbolic, or convex. The curvedness expresses how articulated the local shape is, from flat towards very peaked. In this paper we define corner points as point on a shape of locally maximal Koenderink curvedness. These points can be detected very robustly based on integration indices. This is not the case for other natural corner points like extremal points. Umbilici can likewise be detected robustly by integral expressions, but does not correspond to intuitive corners of a shape. Furthermore, we show that Koenderink corner points do not generically coincide with other well-known shape features such as umbilici, ridges, parabolic lines, sub-parabolic lines, or extremal points. This is formalized through the co-dimension of intersection of the different structures. Keywords: Shape features, shape evolution, differential geometry, singularity theory},

	Abstract = {The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies is a series of neuroimaging data sets that are publicly available for study and analysis. The present MRI data set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96 years all acquired on the same scanner using identical sequences. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least 1 year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. Subjects were characterized using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) as either nondemented or with very mild to mild Alzheimer's disease. Seventy-two of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. Sixty-four of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with CDR 0.5 similar level of impairment to individuals elsewhere considered to have "mild cognitive impairment." Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit (CDR 0) and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit (CDR > 0). The subjects were all right-handed and include both men (n = 62) and women (n = 88). For each scanning session, three or four individual T1-weighted MRI scans were obtained. Multiple within-session acquisitions provide extremely high contrast to noise, making the data amenable to a wide range of analytic approaches including automated computational analysis. Automated calculation of whole-brain volume is presented to demonstrate use of the data for measuring differences associated with normal aging and Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are useful tools to evaluate classifiers in biomedical and bioinformatics applications. However, conclusions are often reached through inconsistent use or insufficient statistical analysis. To support researchers in their ROC curves analysis we developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves in a user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface.
RESULTS: With data previously imported into the R or S+ environment, the pROC package builds ROC curves and includes functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical tests for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the operating points of different classifiers, and methods for smoothing ROC curves. Intermediary and final results are visualised in user-friendly interfaces. A case study based on published clinical and biomarker data shows how to perform a typical ROC analysis with pROC.
CONCLUSIONS: pROC is a package for R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis. It proposes multiple statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in particular partial areas under the curve, allowing proper ROC interpretation. pROC is available in two versions: in the R programming language or with a graphical user interface in the S+ statistical software. It is accessible at http://expasy.org/tools/pROC/ under the GNU General Public License. It is also distributed through the CRAN and CSAN public repositories, facilitating its installation.},

	Abstract = {Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used to describe and compare the performance of diagnostic technology and diagnostic algorithms. This paper refines the statistical comparison of the areas under two ROC curves derived from the same set of patients by taking into account the correlation between the areas that is induced by the paired nature of the data. The correspondence between the area under an ROC curve and the Wilcoxon statistic is used and underlying Gaussian distributions (binormal) are assumed to provide a table that converts the observed correlations in paired ratings of images into a correlation between the two ROC areas. This between-area correlation can be used to reduce the standard error (uncertainty) about the observed difference in areas. This correction for pairing, analogous to that used in the paired t-test, can produce a considerable increase in the statistical sensitivity (power) of the comparison. For studies involving multiple readers, this method provides a measure of a component of the sampling variation that is otherwise difficult to obtain.},

	Abstract = {Imaging studies of cerebral volumes often adjust for factors such as age that may confound between-subject comparisons. However the use of nuisance covariates in imaging studies is inconsistent, which can make interpreting results across studies difficult. Using magnetic resonance images of 78 healthy controls we assessed the effects of age, gender, head size and scanner upgrade on region of interest (ROI) volumetry, cortical thickness and voxel-based morphometric (VBM) measures. We found numerous significant associations between these variables and volumetric measures: cerebral volumes and cortical thicknesses decreased with increasing age, men had larger volumes and smaller thicknesses than women, and increasing head size was associated with larger volumes. The relationships between most ROIs and head size volumes were non-linear. With age, gender, head size and upgrade in one model we found that volumes and thicknesses decreased with increasing age, women had larger volumes than men (VBM, whole-brain and white matter volumes), increasing head size was associated with larger volumes but not cortical thickness, and scanner upgrade had an effect on thickness and some volume measures. The effects of gender on cortical thickness when adjusting for head size, age and upgrade showed some non-significant effect (women>men), whereas the independent effect of head size showed little pattern. We conclude that age and head size should be considered in ROI volume studies, age, gender and upgrade should be considered for cortical thickness studies and all variables require consideration for VBM analyses. Division of all volumes by head size is unlikely to be adequate owing to their non-proportional relationship.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histopathological studies and animal models suggest that hippocampal subfields may be differently affected by aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other diseases. High-resolution images at 4 Tesla depict details of the internal structure of the hippocampus allowing for in vivo volumetry of different subfields. The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to determine patterns of volume loss in hippocampal subfields in normal aging, AD, and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). (2) To determine if measurements of hippocampal subfields provide advantages over total hippocampal volume for differentiation between groups.
METHODS: Ninety-one subjects (53 controls (mean age: 69.3 $\pm$ 7.3), 20 MCI (mean age: 73.6 $\pm$ 7.1), and 18 AD (mean age: 69.1 $\pm$ 9.5) were studied with a high-resolution T2 weighted imaging sequence aimed at the hippocampus. Entorhinal cortex (ERC), subiculum, CA1, CA1-CA2 transition zone (CA1-2), CA3 & dentate gyrus (CA3&DG) were manually marked in the anterior third of the hippocampal body. Hippocampal volume was obtained from the Freesurfer and manually edited.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, AD had smaller volumes of ERC, subiculum, CA1, CA1-2, and total hippocampal volumes. MCI had smaller CA1-2 volumes. Discriminant analysis and power analysis showed that CA1-2 was superior to total hippocampal volume for distinction between controls and MCI.
CONCLUSION: The patterns of subfield atrophy in AD and MCI were consistent with patterns of neuronal cell loss/reduced synaptic density described by histopathology. These preliminary findings suggest that hippocampal subfield volumetry might be a better measure for diagnosis of early AD and for detection of other disease effects than measurement of total hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {The measurement of hippocampal volumes using MRI is a useful in-vivo biomarker for detection and monitoring of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), including during the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) stage. The pathology underlying AD has regionally selective effects within the hippocampus. As such, we predict that hippocampal subfields are more sensitive in discriminating prodromal AD (i.e., a-MCI) from cognitively normal controls than whole hippocampal volumes, and attempt to demonstrate this using a semi-automatic method that can accurately segment hippocampal subfields. High-resolution coronal-oblique T2-weighted images of the hippocampal formation were acquired in 45 subjects (28 controls and 17 a-MCI (mean age: 69.5 $\pm$ 9.2; 70.2 $\pm$ 7.6)). CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4/DG subfields, along with head and tail regions, were segmented using an automatic algorithm. CA1 and CA4/DG segmentations were manually edited. Whole hippocampal volumes were obtained from the subjects' T1-weighted anatomical images. Automatic segmentation produced significant group differences in the following subfields: CA1 (left: p = 0.001, right: p = 0.038), CA4/DG (left: p = 0.002, right: p = 0.043), head (left: p = 0.018, right: p = 0.002), and tail (left: p = 0.019). After manual correction, differences were increased in CA1 (left: p < 0.001, right: p = 0.002), and reduced in CA4/DG (left: p = 0.029, right: p = 0.221). Whole hippocampal volumes significantly differed bilaterally (left: p = 0.028, right: p = 0.009). This pattern of atrophy in a-MCI is consistent with the topography of AD pathology observed in postmortem studies, and corrected left CA1 provided stronger discrimination than whole hippocampal volume (p = 0.03). These results suggest that semi-automatic segmentation of hippocampal subfields is efficient and may provide additional sensitivity beyond whole hippocampal volumes.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal size and neuron number are reduced in a number of conditions, including temporal lobe epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, a decrease with advancing age has also been suggested. The present study examined the entire hippocampal formation of 12 subjects aged from 46 to 85 years and free from neurological disease. The volume of seven subregions (CA1, CA2-3, CA4, dentate gyrus, subiculum, presubiculum and white matter) was determined and the number of neurons estimated in each of these grey matter subregions using the optical dissector technique. There was a significant relationship between CA1 neuron number and cerebrum volume. Multivariate analysis showed the greater contribution to the variance in CA1 neuron number was made by cerebrum volume (69%) rather than age (2%) or sex (1%). The findings of this study show that, in neurologically normal individuals, brain size is a major determinant of the number of CA1 neurons.},

	Abstract = {In order to observe changes owing to aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the volumes of subdivisions of the hippocampus and the number of neurons of the hippocampal formation, 18 normal brains from subjects who died of nonneurological causes and had no history of long-term illness or dementia (ten of these brains comprised the aged control group) and 13 AD brains were analyzed. An optimized design for sampling, measuring volume by using the Cavalieri principle, and counting the number of neurons by using the optical disector was implemented on 50 microns-thick cresyl-violet sections. The mean total volume of the principal subdivisions of the hippocampal formation (fascia dentata, hilus, CA3-2, CA1, and subiculum) showed a negative correlation with age in normal subjects (r = -0.56, 2P < 0.05), and a 32% mean reduction in the AD group compared with controls (P < 0.001). This finding supports the measurement of the coronal cross-sectional area and the volume of the hippocampal formation in the clinical diagnosis of AD. There was an inverse relationship between the age of normal subjects and the number of neurons in CA1 (r = -0.84, 2P < 0.0001) and subiculum (r = -0.49, 2P < 0.05) but not in other subdivisions. Pronounced AD-related reductions in neuron number were found only in the subiculum and the fascia dentata. Compared with controls, both losses represented 23% of neurons (P < 0.05). These results 1) confirm that AD is a qualitatively different process from normal aging and 2) reveal the regional selectivity of neuron loss within the hippocampal formation in aging and AD, which may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms involved in the neuron loss associated with the two processes.},

@article{de-vita03,
	Abstract = {Over recent years, high field MR scanners (3 T and above) have become increasingly widespread due to potential advantages such as higher signal-to-noise ratio. However, few examples of high resolution images covering the whole brain in reasonable acquisition times have been published to date and none have used fast spin echo (FSE), a sequence commonly employed for the acquisition of T(2) weighted images at 1.5 T. This is mostly due to the increased technical challenges associated with uniform signal generation and the increasingly restrictive constraints of current safety guidelines at high field. We investigated 10 volunteers using an FSE sequence optimized to the 4.7 T environment. This sequence allows the acquisition of 17- and 34-slice data sets with an in-plane resolution of approximately 500 microm x 500 microm and a slice thickness of 2 mm, in 5 min 40 s and 11 min 20 s, respectively. The images appear T(2) weighted, although the contrast is due to the combined effects of chosen echo time, magnetization transfer, direct radio frequency saturation and diffusion as well as the T(1) and T(2) relaxation times of the tissue. The result is an excellent detailed visualization of anatomical structures, demonstrating the great potential of 4.7 T MRI for clinical applications. This paper shows that, with careful optimization of sequence parameters, FSE imaging can be used at high field to generate images with high spatial resolution and uniform contrast across the whole brain within the prescribed power deposition limits.},

	Abstract = {Although some older adults experiencing memory problems have been shown to benefit from cognitive training, evidence regarding who will improve from this type of intervention is lacking. Automated hippocampal volumetry might be used to foresee treatment outcomes. We hypothesized that larger hippocampal volumes are associated with greater memory performance changes following training, and that effects are selectively related to specific hippocampal subfields. 19 memory clinic outpatients with subjective memory impairment (mean age=60.9years) underwent MRI-scanning and then followed an eight week training scheme aimed at improving verbal memory. We assessed verbal memory before and after training, and tested whether pretraining hippocampal volumes were related to memory improvements. To delineate regional specificity, we employed a new technique enabling automated volumetry of seven hippocampal subfields - including the cornu ammonis (CA) sectors and the dentate gyrus (DG). The results showed that larger hippocampal volumes before training were related to greater verbal recall improvements. Subfield volumetry revealed specific correlations between memory improvement and pretraining volumes of the left CA2/3 and CA4/DG. Depressive symptoms further gave a unique contribution in predicting gain of the intervention, independent of hippocampal volume. The results indicated that subjects with a stronger depressive symptom load benefited more from the training. A prediction model including baseline CA2/3-volume and depressive symptoms explained 42% of the variation in recall improvement. Our results are the first to suggest that hippocampal subfield volumetry is related to intervention outcomes in older adults experiencing memory problems. Also, previous studies have tended to exclude patients with concomitant depressive symptoms and memory complaints. The present results, however, strengthen the rationale and potential for cognitive intervention in these patients.},

	Abstract = {Atrophy within the hippocampus (HP) as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising biomarker for the progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subregions of the HP along the longitudinal axis have been found to demonstrate unique function, as well as undergo differential changes in the progression to AD. Little is known of relationships between such HP subregions and other potential biomarkers, such as neuropsychological (NP), genetic, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) beta amyloid and tau measures. The purpose of this study was to subdivide the hippocampus to determine how the head, body, and tail were affected in normal control, mild cognitively impaired, and AD subjects, and investigate relationships with HP subregions and other potential biomarkers. MRI scans of 120 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were processed using FreeSurfer, and the HP was subdivided using 3D Slicer. Each subregion was compared among groups, and correlations were used to determine relationships with NP, genetic, and CSF measures. Results suggest that HP subregions are undergoing differential atrophy in AD, and demonstrate unique relationships with NP and CSF data. Discriminant function analyses revealed that these regions, when combined with NP and CSF measures, were able to classify by diagnostic group, and classify MCI subjects who would and would not progress to AD within 12 months.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hippocampus volumetry is a useful surrogate marker for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, but it seems insufficiently sensitive for the aMCI stage. We postulated that some hippocampus subfields are specifically atrophic in aMCI and that measuring hippocampus subfield volumes will improve sensitivity of MR imaging to detect aMCI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated episodic memory and hippocampus subfield volume in 15 patients with aMCI and 15 matched controls. After segmentation of the whole hippocampus from clinical MR imaging, we applied a new computational method allowing fully automated segmentation of the hippocampus subfields. This method used a Bayesian modeling approach to infer segmentations from the imaging data.
RESULTS: In comparison with controls, subiculum and CA2-3 were significantly atrophic in patients with aMCI, whereas total hippocampus volume and other subfields were not. Total hippocampus volume in controls was age-related, whereas episodic memory was the main explanatory variable for both the total hippocampus volume and the subfields that were atrophic in patients with aMCI. Segmenting subfields increases sensitivity to diagnose aMCI from 40% to 73%.
CONCLUSIONS: Measuring CA2-3 and subiculum volumes allows a better detection of aMCI.},

The hypothesis that maltreatment is associated with volume reductions in 3-T MRI subfields containing the DG and CA3 was assessed and made practical by newly released automatic segmentation routines for FreeSurfer. The sample consisted of 193 unmedicated right-handed subjects (38% male, 21.9 $\pm$ 2.1 y of age) selected from the community. Maltreatment was quantified using the Adverse Childhood Experience study and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire scores. The strongest associations between maltreatment and volume were observed in the left CA2-CA3 and CA4-DG subfields, and were not mediated by histories of major depression or posttraumatic stress disorder. Comparing subjects with high vs. low scores on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Adverse Childhood Experience study showed an average volume reduction of 6.3% and 6.1% in the left CA2-CA3 and CA4-DG, respectively. Volume reductions in the CA1 and fimbria were 44% and 60% smaller than in the CA2-CA3. Interestingly, maltreatment was associated with 4.2% and 4.3% reductions in the left presubiculum and subiculum, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that exposure to early stress in humans, as in other animals, affects hippocampal subfield development.},

	Abstract = {We propose a simple but generally applicable approach to improving the accuracy of automatic image segmentation algorithms relative to manual segmentations. The approach is based on the hypothesis that a large fraction of the errors produced by automatic segmentation are systematic, i.e., occur consistently from subject to subject, and serves as a wrapper method around a given host segmentation method. The wrapper method attempts to learn the intensity, spatial and contextual patterns associated with systematic segmentation errors produced by the host method on training data for which manual segmentations are available. The method then attempts to correct such errors in segmentations produced by the host method on new images. One practical use of the proposed wrapper method is to adapt existing segmentation tools, without explicit modification, to imaging data and segmentation protocols that are different from those on which the tools were trained and tuned. An open-source implementation of the proposed wrapper method is provided, and can be applied to a wide range of image segmentation problems. The wrapper method is evaluated with four host brain MRI segmentation methods: hippocampus segmentation using FreeSurfer (Fischl et al., 2002); hippocampus segmentation using multi-atlas label fusion (Artaechevarria et al., 2009); brain extraction using BET (Smith, 2002); and brain tissue segmentation using FAST (Zhang et al., 2001). The wrapper method generates 72%, 14%, 29% and 21% fewer erroneously segmented voxels than the respective host segmentation methods. In the hippocampus segmentation experiment with multi-atlas label fusion as the host method, the average Dice overlap between reference segmentations and segmentations produced by the wrapper method is 0.908 for normal controls and 0.893 for patients with mild cognitive impairment. Average Dice overlaps of 0.964, 0.905 and 0.951 are obtained for brain extraction, white matter segmentation and gray matter segmentation, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are associated with characteristic patterns of neuropathological spread in the brain. Disease progression is usually accompanied by regional atrophy that can be detected noninvasively using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A wealth of data has demonstrated the value of quantitative measurements of regional atrophy in AD, suggesting that volumetric MRI (vMRI) may be a useful clinical tool. vMRI provides biological evidence of neurodegenerative disease in patients with cognitive impairment. However, several hurdles impede implementation of vMRI in clinical practice. These include a lack of standardized MRI acquisition protocols, spatial distortions in MRI data, labor-intensive vMRI methods susceptible to interoperator variability, a lack of normative ranges for volume measures, and difficulty integrating vMRI in clinical workflow. Advances in vMRI have resulted from multi-institutional studies of brain imaging, such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and help address these challenges. New, fully-automated measures of brain structure volumes coupled with large, multi-center studies using standardized MRI protocols now allow the development of age-adjusted normative ranges for vMRI. Such advances are critical for providing physicians a framework for assessing the pattern and degree of regional atrophy in a patient's brain and applying vMRI in clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {Identifying genetic variants influencing human brain structures may reveal new biological mechanisms underlying cognition and neuropsychiatric illness. The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease and is reduced in schizophrenia, major depression and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 × 10(-16)) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 × 10(-12)). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 × 10(-7)).},

	Abstract = {Defining language lateralization is important to minimize morbidity
	in patients treated surgically for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
	Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a promising,
	noninvasive, alternative strategy to the Wada test. Here we have
	used fMRI to study healthy controls and patients with TLE in order
	to (i) define language-related activation patterns and their reproducibility;
	(ii) compare lateralization determined by fMRI with those from of
	the Wada test; and (iii) contrast different methods of assessing
	fMRI lateralization. Twelve healthy right-handed controls and 19
	right-handed preoperative patients with TLE (12 left- and seven right-TLE)
	were studied at 3T using fMRI and a verbal fluency paradigm. A Wada
	test also was performed on each of the patients. Greater activation
	was found in several areas in the right hemisphere for the left-TLE
	group relative to controls or right-TLE patients. Relative hemispheric
	activations calculated based on either the extent or the mean signal
	change gave consistent results showing a more bihemispheric language
	representation in the left-TLE patients. There was good agreement
	between the Wada and fMRI results, although the latter were more
	sensitive to involvement of the nondominant right hemisphere. The
	reproducibility of the fMRI values was lowest for the more bihemispherically
	represented left-TLE patients. Overall, our results further demonstrate
	that noninvasive fMRI measures of language-related lateralization
	may provide a practical and reliable alternative to invasive testing
	for presurgical language lateralization in patients with TLE. The
	high proportion (33\%) of left-TLE patients showing bilateral or
	right hemispheric language-related lateralization suggests that there
	is considerable plasticity of language representation in the brains
	of patients with intractable TLE.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative research in neuroimaging often relies on anatomical segmentation
	of human brain MR images. Recent multi-atlas based approaches provide
	highly accurate structural segmentations of the brain by propagating
	manual delineations from multiple atlases in a database to a query
	subject and combining them. The atlas databases which can be used
	for these purposes are growing steadily. We present a framework to
	address the consequent problems of scale in multi-atlas segmentation.
	We show that selecting a custom subset of atlases for each query
	subject provides more accurate subcortical segmentations than those
	given by non-selective combination of random atlas subsets. Using
	a database of 275 atlases, we tested an image-based similarity criterion
	as well as a demographic criterion (age) in a leave-one-out cross-validation
	study. Using a custom ranking of the database for each subject, we
	combined a varying number n of atlases from the top of the ranked
	list. The resulting segmentations were compared with manual reference
	segmentations using Dice overlap. Image-based selection provided
	better segmentations than random subsets (mean Dice overlap 0.854
	vs. 0.811 for the estimated optimal subset size, n=20). Age-based
	selection resulted in a similar marked improvement. We conclude that
	selecting atlases from large databases for atlas-based brain image
	segmentation improves the accuracy of the segmentations achieved.
	We show that image similarity is a suitable selection criterion and
	give results based on selecting atlases by age that demonstrate the
	value of meta-information for selection.},

@article{allen91,
	Abstract = {The sexual dimorphism of the corpus callosum has remained controversial
	since the original report by de Lacoste-Utamsing and Holloway in
	1982, for several reasons: (1) measurements have been performed in
	a variety of ways in different laboratories, in part because published
	reports frequently do not describe the methodology in detail; (2)
	despite known age-related changes during both childhood and adulthood,
	no investigators have explicitly age-matched subjects; and (3) the
	size and shape of corpora callosa vary considerably among individuals,
	requiring large sample sizes to demonstrate significant sex differences.
	Therefore, we have examined magnetic resonance images for 24 age-matched
	children and 122 age-matched adults for possible sex differences
	in the corpus callosum. While we observed a dramatic sex difference
	in the shape of the corpus callosum, there was no conclusive evidence
	of sexual dimorphism in the area of the corpus callosum or its subdivisions.
	Utilizing several criteria, there were significant sex differences
	in shape: subjective evaluation indicated that the posterior region
	of the corpus callosum, the splenium, was more bulbous shaped in
	females as a group and in women, and more tubular-shaped in males
	as a group and in men; mathematical evaluation confirmed this observation
	in that the maximum width of the splenium was significantly greater
	in women than in men, and that the percentage by which the average
	width of the splenium was greater than that of the adjacent corpus
	callosum was significantly greater in females than in males. However,
	sex differences in bulbosity did not reach significance in children
	(aged 2-16 yr). In contrast, among the area measurements of the corpus
	callosum and 22 subdivisions, only 1 exhibited a significant sex
	difference, which would be expected by chance. The area of the corpora
	callosa increased significantly with age in children and decreased
	significantly with age in adults. In adults, the midsagittal surface
	area of the cerebral cortex decreased significantly with age in women
	but not in men. These anatomical sex differences could, in part,
	underlie gender-related differences in behavior and neuropsychological
	function.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder
	in the elderly. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a relatively
	newly defined clinical entity that requires memory decline while
	activities of daily living remain intact. Most amnestic MCI patients
	develop Alzheimer's disease. Using an innovative surface-based hippocampal
	analytic technique we analysed the structural magnetic resonance
	hippocampal data of 31 amnestic MCI and 34 Alzheimer's disease subjects.
	We tested the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease subjects have greater
	atrophy of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 hippocampal subfields relative to
	amnestic MCI subjects. 3D hippocampal maps localized the main group
	differences to the CA1 region bilaterally and the CA2 and CA3 region
	on the left [corrected] (right [corrected] P = 0.0024, left [corrected]
	P = 0.0002, both corrected for multiple comparisons). Age, race,
	gender, education and Mini-Mental State Examination were significant
	predictors of hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was a significant
	predictor of clinical diagnosis. Our study suggests that as Alzheimer's
	disease progresses, subregional hippocampal atrophy spreads in a

	dissemination. Novel hippocampal analytic techniques that can track
	the spread of hippocampal pathology in 3D with such precision are

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: While most patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
	transition to Alzheimer disease (AD), others develop non-AD dementia,
	remain in the MCI state, or improve. OBJECTIVE: To test the following
	hypotheses: smaller hippocampal volumes predict conversion of MCI
	to AD, whereas larger hippocampal volumes predict cognitive stability
	and/or improvement; and patients with MCI who convert to AD have
	greater atrophy in the CA1 hippocampal subfield and subiculum. DESIGN:
	Prospective longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: University of California-Los
	Angeles Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. PATIENTS: We followed
	up 20 MCI subjects clinically and neuropsychologically for 3 years.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Baseline regional hippocampal atrophy was analyzed
	with region-of-interest and 3-dimensional hippocampal mapping techniques.
	RESULTS: During the 3-year study, 6 patients developed AD (MCI-c),
	7 remained stable (MCI-nc), and 7 improved (MCI-i). Patients with
	MCI-c had 9\% smaller left and 13\% smaller right mean hippocampal
	volumes compared with MCI-nc patients. Radial atrophy maps showed
	greater atrophy of the CA1 subregion in MCI-c. Patients with MCI-c
	had significantly smaller hippocampi than MCI-i patients (left, 24\%;
	right, 27\%). Volumetric analyses showed a trend for greater hippocampal
	atrophy in MCI-nc relative to MCI-i patients (eg, 16\% volume loss).
	After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparison, the atrophy
	maps showed a significant difference on the right. Subicular differences
	were seen between MCI-c and MCI-i patients, and MCI-nc and MCI-i
	patients. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the group
	effect to be highly significant and independent of age, hemisphere,
	and Mini-Mental State Examination scores at baseline. CONCLUSIONS:
	Smaller hippocampi and specifically CA1 and subicular involvement
	are associated with increased risk for conversion from MCI to AD.
	Patients with MCI-i tend to have larger hippocampal volumes and relative
	preservation of both the subiculum and CA1.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to characterize the hippocampal
	formation in patients with schizophrenia by measuring neuron density,
	neuron size, and variability of neuronal axis orientation. METHOD:
	Brain tissue was obtained at autopsy from 14 prospectively accrued
	elderly patients with chronic schizophrenia and 10 age-compatible
	individuals without psychiatric disorder. Eight hippocampal regions
	of interest and two internal control regions (primary motor and visual
	cortices) were identified on Nissl-stained sections. Morphometric
	measurements were made without knowledge of diagnosis by means of
	a computer-based image analysis system. RESULTS: The patients exhibited
	smaller neuron size in the hippocampal regions relative to the control
	regions, which was significant only for the subiculum, CA1, and layer
	II of the entorhinal cortex. Neuron size in the control regions was
	nearly identical in the two groups. No significant differences in
	neuron density or in variability of neuronal axis orientation were
	identified for any region. There was no correlation between neuron
	size in any area and several potentially confounding variables (age,
	post-mortem interval, neuroleptic exposure, sex, brain hemisphere
	studied, duration of illness), with the exception of a negative correlation
	with age in layer II of the entorhinal cortex. Regression analyses
	indicated that the findings could not be attributed to these age
	effects. CONCLUSIONS: The subiculum, entorhinal cortex, and CA1 are
	the major subfields of the hippocampal region that maintain the afferent
	and efferent connections of the hippocampus with widespread cortical
	and subcortical targets. The smaller size of neurons in these subfields
	may reflect the presence of structural or functional impairments
	that disrupt these connections, which in turn could have important
	behavioral sequelae.},

	Euclidean operations on matrices suffer from many defects on tensors,

	properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler
	and faster computations. This new approach is based on a novel vector
	space structure for tensors. In this framework, Riemannian computations
	can be converted into Euclidean ones once tensors have been transformed

	Abstract = {It has been shown that employing multiple atlas images improves segmentation
	accuracy in atlas-based medical image segmentation. Each atlas image
	is registered to the target image independently and the calculated
	transformation is applied to the segmentation of the atlas image
	to obtain a segmented version of the target image. Several independent
	candidate segmentations result from the process, which must be somehow
	combined into a single final segmentation. Majority voting is the
	generally used rule to fuse the segmentations, but more sophisticated
	methods have also been proposed. In this paper, we show that the
	use of global weights to ponderate candidate segmentations has a
	major limitation. As a means to improve segmentation accuracy, we
	propose the generalized local weighting voting method. Namely, the
	fusion weights adapt voxel-by-voxel according to a local estimation
	of segmentation performance. Using digital phantoms and MR images
	of the human brain, we demonstrate that the performance of each combination
	technique depends on the gray level contrast characteristics of the
	segmented region, and that no fusion method yields better results
	than the others for all the regions. In particular, we show that
	local combination strategies outperform global methods in segmenting
	high-contrast structures, while global techniques are less sensitive
	to noise when contrast between neighboring structures is low. We
	conclude that, in order to achieve the highest overall segmentation

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for the coregistration and partitioning
	(i.e., tissue segmentation) of brain images that have been acquired
	in different modalities. The basic idea is that instead of matching
	two images directly, one performs intermediate within-modality registrations
	to two template images that are already in register. One can use
	a least-squares minimization to determine the affine transformations
	that map between the templates and the images. By incorporating suitable
	constraints, a rigid body transformation which directly maps between
	the images can be extracted from these more general affine transformations.
	A further refinement capitalizes on the implicit normalization of
	both images into a standard space. This facilitates segmentation
	or partitioning of both original images into homologous tissue classifications.
	Once partitioned, the partitions can be jointly matched, further
	increasing the accuracy of the coregistration. In short, these techniques
	reduce the between-modality problem to a series of simpler within-modality
	problems. These methods are relatively robust, address a number of

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive abilities of older persons range from normal,
	to mild cognitive impairment, to dementia. Few large longitudinal
	studies have compared the natural history of mild cognitive impairment
	with similar persons without cognitive impairment. METHODS: Participants
	were older Catholic clergy without dementia, 211 with mild cognitive
	impairment and 587 without cognitive impairment, who underwent annual
	clinical evaluation for AD and an assessment of different cognitive
	abilities. Cognitive performance tests were summarized to yield a
	composite measure of global cognitive function and separate summary
	measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual
	speed, and visuospatial ability. The authors compared the risk of
	death, risk of incident AD, and rates of change in global cognition
	and different cognitive domains among persons with mild cognitive
	impairment to those without cognitive impairment. All models controlled
	for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: On average, persons with mild
	cognitive impairment had significantly lower scores at baseline in
	all cognitive domains. Over an average of 4.5 years of follow-up,
	30\% of persons with mild cognitive impairment died, a rate 1.7 times
	higher than those without cognitive impairment (95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.5).
	In addition, 64 (34\%) persons with mild cognitive impairment developed
	AD, a rate 3.1 times higher than those without cognitive impairment
	(95\% CI, 2.1 to 4.5). Finally, persons with mild cognitive impairment
	declined significantly faster on measures of episodic memory, semantic
	memory, and perceptual speed, but not on measures of working memory
	or visuospatial ability, as compared with persons without cognitive
	impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Mild cognitive impairment is associated
	with an increased risk of death and incident AD, and a greater rate
	of decline in selected cognitive abilities.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of CSF biomarkers in patients
	with known pathology due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).
	BACKGROUND: It is important to distinguish FTLD from other neurodegenerative
	diseases like Alzheimer disease (AD), but this may be difficult clinically
	because of atypical presentations. METHODS: Patients with FTLD (n
	= 30) and AD (n = 19) were identified at autopsy or on the basis
	of genetic testing at University of Pennsylvania and Erasmus University
	Medical Center. CSF was obtained during a diagnostic lumbar puncture
	and was analyzed using assays for total tau and amyloid-beta 1-42
	(A beta(42)). Patients also were assessed with a brief neuropsychological
	battery. RESULTS: CSF total tau level and the ratio of CSF total
	tau to A beta(42) (tau/A beta(42)) were significantly lower in FTLD
	than in AD. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses confirmed
	that the CSF tau/A beta(42) ratio is sensitive and specific at discriminating
	between FTLD and AD, and is more successful at this than CSF total
	tau alone. Although some neuropsychological measures are significantly
	different in autopsy-proven FTLD and AD, combining these neuropsychological
	measures with CSF biomarkers did not improve the ability to distinguish
	FTLD from AD. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of CSF tau/A beta(42) is a sensitive
	and specific biomarker at discriminating frontotemporal lobar degeneration
	from Alzheimer disease in patients with known pathology.},

	of life, of cerebrospinal fluid, subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid,
	total brain volume, total ventricular volume (component ventricular
	volumes of lateral, temporal horn, and third and fourth ventricles)
	and estimates of white and gray matter, based on a multispectral
	segmentation of brain MR. This database is presented as a reference
	for future studies comparing pathologic states. METHOD: One hundred
	ninety-four healthy subjects, ranging in age from 16 to 65 years,
	received standard axial intermediate- and T2-weighted spin-echo MR
	images. Multispectral segmentation and volume analysis were performed
	using ANALYZE. RESULTS: Normative volumetric estimates, both uncorrected
	and corrected for differences in total intracranial volume, were
	obtained for all subjects and presented by decade and sex. Age-related
	cerebrospinal fluid changes were evident for both male and female
	subjects. Most gender differences were eliminated by correction for
	differences in total intracranial volume. Standard and fast spin-echo
	acquisition methods gave comparable volume estimates. Total brain
	volume measurements from MR compare favorably with data from large

	generalizations, these normative data tables can provide a comparison
	index for contrasting pathologic groups with a normative sample.},

	Abstract = {The total numbers of neurons with and without neurofibrillary changes
	in the hippocampal subdivisions were estimated in 16 subjects with
	Alzheimer disease (AD) and in 5 normal elderly controls. On the basis
	of clinical symptoms, AD patients were subdivided into relatively
	less (AD-1. Functional Assessment Staging [FAST] stages 7a to 7c)
	and more severely affected (AD-2, FAST stages 7e to 7f) patient groups.
	In the AD-1 group relative to controls, the total number of neurons
	was reduced only in CA1 and in the subiculum. In the AD-2 group,
	neuronal losses were found in all sectors of the cornu Ammonis and
	in the subiculum and ranged from 53\% in CA3 to 86\% in CA1. The
	dentate gyrus was the only hippocampal subdivision without significant
	neuronal loss. Within the combined AD patient groups, significant
	correlations were noted between both clinical stage and duration
	of AD and both the total number of neurons and the percentage of
	neurons with neurofibrillary changes in CA1, CA4, and the subiculum.
	Regression analyses predicted neuronal losses over the maximal observed
	duration of 22 years of 87\% in CA1, 63\% in CA4, and 77\% in the
	subiculum. Our data suggest that over the course of AD, continuous
	neurofibrillary tangle formation and continuous neuronal loss occur
	in the hippocampal subdivisions. The rate of neuronal loss appears
	to be similar for CA1, CA4, and the subiculum.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE)
	is the chief known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, the
	most common cause of dementia late in life. To determine the relation
	between brain responses to tasks requiring memory and the genetic
	risk of Alzheimer's disease, we performed APOE genotyping and functional
	magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain in older persons with
	intact cognition. METHODS: We studied 30 subjects (age, 47 to 82
	years) who were neurologically normal, of whom 16 were carriers of
	the APOE epsilon4 allele and 14 were homozygous for the APOE epsilon3
	allele. The mean age and level of education were similar in the two
	groups. Patterns of brain activation during functional MRI scanning
	were determined while subjects memorized and recalled unrelated pairs
	of words and while subjects rested between such periods. Memory was
	reassessed in 14 subjects two years later. RESULTS: Both the magnitude
	and the extent of brain activation during memory-activation tasks
	in regions affected by Alzheimer's disease, including the left hippocampal,
	parietal, and prefrontal regions, were greater among the carriers
	of the APOE epsilon4 allele than among the carriers of the APOE epsilon3
	allele. During periods of recall, the carriers of the APOE epsilon4
	allele had a greater average increase in signal intensity in the
	hippocampal region (1.03 percent vs. 0.62 percent, P<0.001) and a
	greater mean (+/-SD) number of activated regions throughout the brain
	(15.9+/-6.2 vs. 9.4+/-5.5, P=0.005) than did carriers of the APOE
	epsilon3 allele. Longitudinal assessment after two years indicated
	that the degree of base-line brain activation correlated with degree
	of decline in memory. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of brain activation during
	tasks requiring memory differ depending on the genetic risk of Alzheimer's
	disease and may predict a subsequent decline in memory.},

	and its role in neurodegenerative diseases. Manual segmentation protocols
	have established a volume decline in the HC in conjunction with Alzheimer's
	disease, epilepsy, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression.
	Furthermore, recent studies have investigated age-related changes
	of HC volume which show an interaction with gender; in early adulthood,
	volume reduction of the HC is found in men but not in women. In this
	paper, we investigated gender differences in normal subjects in young
	adulthood by employing a shape analysis of the HC using medial surfaces.
	For each subject, the most prominent medial manifold of the HC was
	extracted and flattened. The flattened sheets were then registered
	using both a rigid and a non-rigid alignment technique, and the medial
	surface radius was expressed as a height function over them. This
	allowed for an investigation of the association between subject variables
	and the local width of the HC. With regard to the effects of age
	and gender, it could be shown that the previously observed gender
	differences were mostly due to volume loss in males in the lateral
	areas of the HC head and tail. We suggest that the analysis of HC
	shape using medial surfaces might thus serve as a complimentary technique
	to investigate group differences to the established segmentation
	protocols for volume quantification in MRI.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Necropsy confirmed clinical diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's
	disease is claimed to exceed 90\%. This figure contains two fallacies;
	it includes cases in which Alzheimer's disease exists with other
	diseases affecting cognition and the studies that report these figures
	excluded cases without necropsy (verification bias). The effect of
	these errors is estimated. METHODS: Data were taken from the University
	of Western Ontario Dementia Study, a registry of dementia cases with
	clinical and psychometric follow up to necropsy based in a university
	memory disorders clinic with secondary and tertiary referrals. Data
	were available on 307 patients; 200 (65\%) had clinically diagnosed
	Alzheimer's disease, 12 (4\%) vascular dementia, 47 (15\%) mixed
	dementia, and 48 (16\%) had other diagnoses. One hundred and ninety
	two of 307 cases (63\%) died and 122 of 192 fatalities (64\%) had
	necropsies. The pathological material was interpreted in two ways,
	allowing and disallowing coexistent disease in making a diagnosis
	of Alzheimer's disease. In cases without necropsy, progressive cognitive
	loss was used as a marker for degenerative dementia. The outcome
	measures of interest were the positive predictive value of a clinical
	diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease allowing and disallowing coexistent
	diseases and with and without correction for cases that were not
	necropsied. RESULTS: The clinical diagnoses differed significantly
	between the population who died and those who did not. In cases without
	necropsy, 22\% had no dementia on follow up, concentrated in early
	cases and men, showing considerable scope for verification bias.
	The positive predictive value of a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
	was 81\% including coexistent diseases, falling to 44\% when limited
	to pure cases. Combined, these factors reduce the positive predictive
	value to 38\% for pure Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Correction
	for dual pathology and verification bias halves the positive predictive
	value of the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Data derived
	from necropsy studies cannot be extrapolated to the whole population.
	This has important implications including uncertainty about diagnosis
	and prognosis and a dilution effect in therapeutic trials in Alzheimer's
	disease.},

	clinical and CSF study of 86 subjects, including 22 MCI patients
	that declined to AD (MCI-AD), 43 MCI that did not deteriorate (MCI-MCI)
	and 21 controls (NL-NL). All subjects were studied for total and

	Abstract = {The evaluation of atrophy quantification methods based on magnetic
	resonance imaging have been usually hindered by the lack of realistic
	gold standard data against which to judge these methods or to help
	refine them. Recently [Camara, O., Schweiger, M., Scahill, R., Crum,
	W., Sneller, B., Schnabel, J., Ridgway, G., Cash, D., Hill, D., Fox,
	N., 2006. Phenomenological model of diffuse global and regional atrophy
	using finite-element methods. IEEE Trans. Med.l Imaging 25, 1417-1430],
	we presented a technique in which atrophy is realistically simulated
	in different tissue compartments or neuroanatomical structures with
	a phenomenological model. In this study, we have generated a cohort
	of realistic simulated Alzheimer's disease (AD) images with known
	amounts of atrophy, mimicking a set of 19 real controls and 27 probable
	AD subjects, with an improved version of our atrophy simulation methodology.
	This database was then used to assess the accuracy of several well-known
	computational anatomy methods which provide global (BSI and SIENA)
	or local (Jacobian integration) estimates of longitudinal atrophy
	in brain structures using MR images. SIENA and BSI results correlated
	very well with gold standard data (Pearson coefficient of 0.962 and
	0.969 respectively), achieving small mean absolute differences with
	respect to the gold standard (percentage change from baseline volume):
	BSI of 0.23\%+/-0.26\%; SIENA of 0.22\%+/-0.28\%. Jacobian integration
	was guided by both fluid and FFD-based registration techniques and
	resulting deformation fields and associated Jacobians were compared,
	region by region, with gold standard ones. The FFD-based technique
	outperformed the fluid one in all evaluated structures (mean absolute
	differences from the gold standard in percentage change from baseline
	volume): whole brain, FFD=0.31\%, fluid=0.58\%; lateral ventricles,
	FFD=0.79\%; fluid=1.45\%; left hippocampus, FFD=0.82\%; fluid=1.42\%;
	right hippocampus, FFD=0.95\%; fluid=1.62\%. The largest errors for
	both local techniques occurred in the sulcal CSF (FFD=2.27\%; fluid=3.55\%)
	regions. For large structures such as the whole brain, these mean
	absolute differences, relative to the applied atrophy, represented
	similar percentages for the BSI, SIENA and FFD techniques (controls/patients):
	BSI, 51.99\%/16.36\%; SIENA, 62.34\%/21.59\%; FFD, 41.02\%/24.95\%.
	For small structures such as the hippocampi, these percentages were
	larger, especially for controls where errors were approximately equal
	to the small applied changes (controls/patients): FFD, 92.82\%/43.61\%.
	However, these apparently large relative errors have not prevented
	the global or hippocampal measures from finding significant group
	separation in our study. The evaluation framework presented here
	will help in quantifying whether the accuracy of future methodological
	developments is sufficient for analysing change in smaller or less
	atrophied local brain regions. Results obtained in our experiments
	with realistic simulated data confirm previously published estimates
	of accuracy for both evaluated global techniques. Regarding Jacobian
	Integration methods, the FFD-based one demonstrated promising results
	and potential for being used in clinical studies alongside (or in
	place of) the more common global methods. The generated gold standard
	data has also allowed us to identify some stages and sets of parameters
	in the evaluated techniques--the brain extraction step in the global
	techniques and the number of multi-resolution levels and the stopping
	criteria in the registration-based methods--that are critical for
	their accuracy.},

	Abstract = {This study assesses the performance of public-domain automated methodologies
	for MRI-based segmentation of the hippocampus in elderly subjects
	with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
	Structural MR images of 54 age- and gender-matched healthy elderly
	individuals, subjects with probable AD, and subjects with MCI were
	collected at the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research
	Center. Hippocampi in subject images were automatically segmented
	by using AIR, SPM, FLIRT, and the fully deformable method of Chen
	to align the images to the Harvard atlas, MNI atlas, and randomly
	selected, manually labeled subject images ("cohort atlases"). Mixed-effects
	statistical models analyzed the effects of side of the brain, disease
	state, registration method, choice of atlas, and manual tracing protocol
	on the spatial overlap between automated segmentations and expert
	manual segmentations. Registration methods that produced higher degrees
	of geometric deformation produced automated segmentations with higher
	agreement with manual segmentations. Side of the brain, presence
	of AD, choice of reference image, and manual tracing protocol were
	also significant factors contributing to automated segmentation performance.
	Fully automated techniques can be competitive with human raters on
	this difficult segmentation task, but a rigorous statistical analysis
	shows that a variety of methodological factors must be carefully
	considered to insure that automated methods perform well in practice.
	The use of fully deformable registration methods, cohort atlases,
	and user-defined manual tracings are recommended for highest performance
	in fully automated hippocampus segmentation.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The corpus callosum is the primary anatomical substrate
	for interhemispheric communication, which is important for a range
	of adaptive and cognitive behaviors in early development. Previous
	studies that have measured the corpus callosum in developmental populations
	have been limited by the use of rather arbitrary methods of subdividing
	the corpus callosum. The purpose of this study was to measure the
	corpus callosum in a clinical group of developmentally delayed children
	using a subdivision that more accurately reflected the anatomical
	properties of the corpus callosum. METHOD: The authors applied tractography
	to subdivide the corpus callosum into regions corresponding to the
	cortical regions to and from which its fibers travel in a clinical
	group of very young children with developmental delay, a precursor
	to general mental retardation, in comparison with typically developing
	children. RESULTS: The data demonstrate that the midsagittal area
	of the entire corpus callosum is reduced in children presenting with
	developmental delay, reflected in the smaller area of each of the
	fiber-based callosal subdivisions. In addition, while the area of
	each subdivision was strongly and significantly correlated with the
	corresponding cortical white matter volume in comparison subjects,
	this correlation was prominently absent in the developmentally delayed
	group. CONCLUSIONS: A fiber-based subdivision successfully separates
	lobar regions of the corpus callosum, and the areas of these regions
	distinguish a developmentally delayed clinical group from the comparison
	group. This distinction was evident both in the area measurements
	themselves and in their correlation to the white matter volumes of
	the corresponding cortical lobes.},

	Abstract = {The authors are developing a computer-aided detection (CAD) system
	for masses on digital breast tomosynthesis mammograms (DBT). Three
	approaches were evaluated in this study. In the first approach, mass
	candidate identification and feature analysis are performed in the
	reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) DBT volume. A mass likelihood
	score is estimated for each mass candidate using a linear discriminant
	analysis (LDA) classifier. Mass detection is determined by a decision
	threshold applied to the mass likelihood score. A free response receiver
	operating characteristic (FROC) curve that describes the detection
	sensitivity as a function of the number of false positives (FPs)
	per breast is generated by varying the decision threshold over a
	range. In the second approach, prescreening of mass candidate and
	feature analysis are first performed on the individual two-dimensional
	(2D) projection view (PV) images. A mass likelihood score is estimated
	for each mass candidate using an LDA classifier trained for the 2D
	features. The mass likelihood images derived from the PVs are backprojected
	to the breast volume to estimate the 3D spatial distribution of the
	mass likelihood scores. The FROC curve for mass detection can again
	be generated by varying the decision threshold on the 3D mass likelihood
	scores merged by backprojection. In the third approach, the mass
	likelihood scores estimated by the 3D and 2D approaches, described
	above, at the corresponding 3D location are combined and evaluated
	using FROC analysis. A data set of 100 DBT cases acquired with a
	GE prototype system at the Breast Imaging Laboratory in the Massachusetts
	General Hospital was used for comparison of the three approaches.
	The LDA classifiers with stepwise feature selection were designed
	with leave-one-case-out resampling. In FROC analysis, the CAD system
	for detection in the DBT volume alone achieved test sensitivities
	of 80\% and 90\% at average FP rates of 1.94 and 3.40 per breast,
	respectively. With the 2D detection approach, the FP rates were 2.86
	and 4.05 per breast, respectively, at the corresponding sensitivities.
	In comparison, the average FP rates of the system combining the 3D
	and 2D information were 1.23 and 2.04 per breast, respectively, at
	80\% and 90\% sensitivities. The difference in the detection performances
	between the 2D and the 3D approach, and that between the 3D and the
	combined approach were both statistically significant (p = 0.02 and
	0.01, respectively) as estimated by alternative FROC analysis. The
	combined system is a promising approach to improving automated mass
	detection on DBTs.},

	Abstract = {While decrements in memory following temporal lobectomy for intractable
	epilepsy remain a major neurocognitive complication of surgical intervention,
	it has been difficult to identify patients who are most at risk for
	developing decrements in their memory functions following surgery.
	Two different models of hippocampal functioning have been posited
	to account for postsurgical memory losses: hippocampal reserve versus
	functional adequacy. This article briefly examines the basis of the
	traditional model of hippocampal reserve, which suggests that it
	is the reserve or capacity of the contralateral hippocampus to support
	memory after surgery that determines whether changes in memory function
	will be observed. A more in-depth review of emerging data from studies
	of function (baseline neuropsychological testing and intracarotid
	amytal procedure) and structure (histologic cell densities and MRI
	volumetrics) supporting a functional adequacy model of hippocampal
	functioning is then presented. Data from these latter studies provide
	strong convergent support for the view that the risk for memory decrements
	following mesial temporal lobe epilepsy surgery is inversely related
	to the functional adequacy of the tissue to be resected. Data reviewed
	here have broad implications for the field of neuropsychology. Not
	only do the data reported in this article challenge some of the basic
	tenets of our understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory
	functioning, but they illustrate the importance of ongoing research,
	critical reevaluation of basic concepts, and the importance of self-scrutiny

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) has been shown to
	predict verbal memory changes after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL).
	Seeking to extend these findings, we examined two questions: (a)
	What is the relationship between material-specific aspects of IAT
	memory and material-specific memory changes after ATL? and (b) Which
	IAT memory score(s) optimally predict memory changes after surgery,
	the memory score after injection ipsilateral to the seizure focus,
	the memory score after injection contralateral to the seizure focus,
	or the IAT asymmetry score, comprising the ipsilateral minus contralateral
	injection scores? METHODS: Seventy left hemisphere language-dominant
	patients undergoing ATL for treatment of medically refractory seizures
	were administered a verbal and visuospatial recognition memory test
	before surgery and 3 weeks after surgery. IAT memory recognition
	scores for words and designs were used to predict verbal and visuospatial
	memory changes after surgery. RESULTS: After surgery, left ATL patients
	declined in verbal memory, whereas right ATL patients declined in
	visuospatial memory. IAT total recognition memory scores (collapsed
	across all types of materials) and IAT word memory scores were associated
	with postoperative verbal memory decline. This relationship was significant
	for the IAT ipsilateral injection memory scores and the IAT hemispheric
	asymmetry scores. IAT memory performances were not related to visuospatial
	memory changes. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate IAT memory measures
	to be related to postoperative verbal, but not visuospatial, memory
	change. A specific relationship was found between postoperative verbal
	memory change and IAT verbal memory after injection ipsilateral to
	the seizure focus, when relying primarily on the contralateral hemisphere.
	This finding is consistent with the functional reserve model of memory
	change in ATL.},

	Abstract = {We present a unified statistical framework for analyzing temporally
	varying brain morphology using the 3D displacement vector field from
	a nonlinear deformation required to register a subject's brain to
	an atlas brain. The unification comes from a single model for structural
	change, rather than two separate models, one for displacement and
	one for volume changes. The displacement velocity field rather than
	the displacement itself is used to set up a linear model to account
	for temporal variations. By introducing the rate of the Jacobian
	change of the deformation, the local volume change at each voxel
	can be computed and used to measure possible brain tissue growth
	or loss. We have applied this method to detecting regions of a morphological
	change in a group of children and adolescents. Using structural magnetic
	resonance images for 28 children and adolescents taken at different
	time intervals, we demonstrate how this method works.},

	Abstract = {Functional imaging with positron emission tomography and functional
	MRI has revolutionized studies of the human brain. Understanding
	the organization of brain systems, especially those used for cognition,
	remains limited, however, because no methods currently exist for
	noninvasive tracking of neuronal connections between functional regions
	[Crick, F. & Jones, E. (1993) Nature (London) 361, 109-110]. Detailed
	connectivities have been studied in animals through invasive tracer
	techniques, but these invasive studies cannot be done in humans,
	and animal results cannot always be extrapolated to human systems.
	We have developed noninvasive neuronal fiber tracking for use in
	living humans, utilizing the unique ability of MRI to characterize
	water diffusion. We reconstructed fiber trajectories throughout the
	brain by tracking the direction of fastest diffusion (the fiber direction)
	from a grid of seed points, and then selected tracks that join anatomically
	or functionally (functional MRI) defined regions. We demonstrate
	diffusion tracking of fiber bundles in a variety of white matter
	classes with examples in the corpus callosum, geniculo-calcarine,
	and subcortical association pathways. Tracks covered long distances,
	navigated through divergences and tight curves, and manifested topological
	separations in the geniculo-calcarine tract consistent with tracer
	studies in animals and retinotopy studies in humans. Additionally,
	previously undescribed topologies were revealed in the other pathways.
	This approach enhances the power of modern imaging by enabling study
	of fiber connections among anatomically and functionally defined
	brain regions in individual human subjects.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become the major imaging
	modality to study properties of white matter and the geometry of
	fiber tracts of the human brain. Clinical studies mostly focus on
	regional statistics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity
	(MD) derived from tensors. Existing analysis techniques do not sufficiently
	take into account that the measurements are tensors, and thus require
	proper interpolation and statistics of tensors, and that regions

	a new framework for quantitative tract-oriented DTI analysis that
	systematically includes tensor interpolation and averaging, using
	nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. A new measure of tensor anisotropy,
	called geodesic anisotropy (GA) is applied and compared with FA.
	As a result, tracts of interest are represented by the geometry of
	the medial spine attributed with tensor statistics (average and variance)
	calculated within cross-sections. Feasibility of our approach is
	demonstrated on various fiber tracts of a single data set. A validation

	Abstract = {Nonrigid registration (NRR) is routinely used in the study of neuroanatomy
	and function and is a standard component of analysis packages such
	as SPM. There remain many unresolved correspondence problems that
	arise from attempts to associate functional areas with specific neuroanatomy
	and to compare both function and anatomy across patient groups. Problems
	can result from ignorance of the underlying neurology which is then
	compounded by unjustified inferences drawn from the results of NRR.
	Usually the magnitude, distribution, and significance of errors in
	NRR are unknown so the errors in correspondences determined by NRR
	are also unknown and their effect on experimental results cannot
	easily be quantified. In this paper we review the principles by which
	the presumed correspondence and homology of structures is used to
	drive registration and identify the conceptual and algorithmic areas
	where current techniques are lacking. We suggest that for applications
	using NRR to be robust and achieve their potential, context-specific
	definitions of correspondence must be developed which properly characterise
	error. Prior knowledge of image content must be utilised to monitor
	and guide registration and gauge the degree of success. The use of
	NRR in voxel-based morphometry is examined from this context and
	found wanting. We conclude that a move away from increasingly sophisticated
	but context-free registration technology is required and that the
	veracity of studies that rely on NRR should be keenly questioned
	when the error distribution is unknown and the results are unsupported
	by other contextual information.},

	Abstract = {Registration using models of compressible viscous fluids has not found
	the general application of some other techniques (e.g., free-form-deformation
	(FFD)) despite its ability to model large diffeomorphic deformations.
	We report on a multi-resolution fluid registration algorithm which
	improves on previous work by (a) directly solving the Navier-Stokes
	equation at the resolution of the images, (b) accommodating image
	sampling anisotropy using semi-coarsening and implicit smoothing
	in a full multi-grid (FMG) solver and (c) exploiting the inherent
	multi-resolution nature of FMG to implement a multi-scale approach.
	Evaluation is on five magnetic resonance (MR) breast images subject
	to six biomechanical deformation fields over 11 multi-resolution
	schemes. Quantitative assessment is by tissue overlaps and target
	registration errors and by registering using the known correspondences
	rather than image features to validate the fluid model. Context is
	given by comparison with a validated FFD algorithm and by application
	to images of volunteers subjected to large applied deformation. The
	results show that fluid registration of 3D breast MR images to sub-voxel

	In this study, antemortem magnetic resonance scans were collected

	later came to autopsy. Significant correlations were observed between
	antemortem hippocampal volumes and both dementia severity and the
	density of hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy. Total
	cerebral volumes, in contrast, were significantly correlated with
	the density of hippocampal senile plaques. The data suggest that

	Abstract = {Structural deformity of the hippocampus is characteristic of individuals
	with very mild and mild forms of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT).
	The purpose of this study was to determine whether a similar deformity
	of the hippocampus can predict the onset of dementia in nondemented
	elders. Using high dimensional diffeomorphic transformations of a
	neuroanatomical template, hippocampal volumes and surfaces were defined
	in 49 nondemented elders; the hippocampal surface was subsequently
	partitioned into three zones (i.e., lateral, superior and inferior-medial),
	which were proximal to the underlying CA1 subfield, CA2-4 subfields
	plus dentate gyrus, and subiculum, respectively. Annual clinical
	assessments using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), where
	CDR 0 indicates no dementia and CDR 0.5 indicates very mild dementia,
	were then performed for a mean of 4.9 years (range 0.9-7.1 years)
	to monitor subjects who converted from CDR 0 to CDR 0.5. Inward variation
	of the lateral zone and left hippocampal volume significantly predicted
	conversion to CDR 0.5 in separate Cox proportional hazards models.
	When hippocampal surface variation and volume were included in a
	single model, inward variation of the lateral zone of the left hippocampal
	surface was selected as the only significant predictor of conversion.
	The pattern of hippocampal surface deformation observed in nondemented
	subjects who later converted to CDR 0.5 was similar to the pattern
	of hippocampal surface deformation previously observed to discriminate
	subjects with very mild DAT and nondemented subjects. These results
	suggest that inward deformation of the left hippocampal surface in
	a zone corresponding to the CA1 subfield is an early predictor of
	the onset of DAT in nondemented elderly subjects.},

	Abstract = {When a head is placed in an MRI scanner, differences between the magnetic
	susceptibility of tissue, bone, and air distort the magnetic field.
	While some of the resulting inhomogeneity can be corrected by the
	shimming process, much of it cannot, and this causes distortion (sometimes
	referred to as geometric distortion) of echo-planar images (EPIs).
	One strategy for the correction of distortion is to acquire a map
	of the magnetic field achieved in each subject and then to use this
	to undistort their EPIs after reconstruction (). Here, we present
	five experiments to evaluate the application of such a strategy on
	data from a 3-T scanner. We show that after undistortion, the shape
	of EPIs is more similar to the true shape of the brain, and we investigate
	the effect of head movement on the efficacy of undistortion. If undistortion
	was applied first, it was found that less nonlinear warping was required
	to transform EPIs into a standard space, particularly in the phase-encode
	direction. We show that if SPM 99 normalization is used to perform
	a nonlinear warp to standard space, the prior application of undistortion
	increases the statistical power of group studies with motor and auditory
	tasks. We show that this increase in power is due to an increase
	in the overlap of activation of different subjects. Finally, we evaluate
	where in the brain undistorting EPIs might be expected to have the
	greatesteffect, in terms both of mislocalization of activationand
	of a reduction in power. Overall, undistorting EPIs using field maps
	has proved extremely successful, improving the anatomical localization
	of activation and increasing statistical power.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is a major structure of interest affected by temporal
	lobe epilepsy (TLE). Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis has
	traditionally been used to study hippocampal involvement in TLE,
	although spatial variation of structural and functional pathology
	have been known to exist within the ROI. In this article, structure-specific
	analysis (Yushkevich et al. (2007) Neuroimage 35:1516-1530) is applied
	to the study of both structure and function in TLE patients. This
	methodology takes into account information about the spatial correspondence
	of voxels within ROIs on left and right sides of the same subject
	as well as between subjects. Hippocampal thickness is studied as
	a measure of structural integrity, and functional activation in a
	functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which
	subjects performed a memory encoding task is studied as a measure
	of functional integrity. Pronounced disease-related decrease in thickness
	is found in posterior and anterior hippocampus. A region in the body
	also shows increased thickness in patients' healthy hippocampi compared
	with controls. Functional activation in diseased hippocampi is reduced
	in the body region compared to controls, whereas a region in the
	tail showing greater right-lateralized activation in controls also
	shows greater activation in healthy hippocampi compared with the
	diseased side in patients. Summary measurements generated by integrating
	quantities of interest over the entire hippocampus can also be used,
	as is done in conventional ROI analysis. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	that are highly localized in space and of linear nature, whereas
	it is significantly reduced in cases with group differences of similar

	Abstract = {We describe a method for automatically building statistical shape
	models from a training set of example boundaries/surfaces. These
	models show considerable promise as a basis for segmenting and interpreting
	images. One of the drawbacks of the approach is, however, the need
	to establish a set of dense correspondences between all members of
	a set of training shapes. Often this is achieved by locating a set
	of "landmarks" manually on each training image, which is time consuming
	and subjective in two dimensions and almost impossible in three dimensions.
	We describe how shape models can be built automatically by posing
	the correspondence problem as one of finding the parameterization
	for each shape in the training set. We select the set of parameterizations
	that build the "best" model. We define "best" as that which minimizes
	the description length of the training set, arguing that this leads
	to models with good compactness, specificity and generalization ability.
	We show how a set of shape parameterizations can be represented and
	manipulated in order to build a minimum description length model.
	Results are given for several different training sets of two-dimensional
	boundaries, showing that the proposed method constructs better models
	than other approaches including manual landmarking-the current gold
	standard. We also show that the method can be extended straightforwardly

	Wada testing for pre-surgical evaluation. Four patients were left-hemisphere-dominant
	and three were right-hemisphere-dominant for language. They received
	fMRI scans while they made semantic or perceptual judgments about
	visually presented words. Regions of the inferior frontal gyrus (pars
	triangularis and pars orbitalis) and neighbouring orbital cortex,
	corresponding to portions of Brodmann areas 45, 46 and 47, exhibited
	significant increases in activation during semantic relative to perceptual
	judgments. Lateralization of the increases in activation were consistent
	with the Wada test assessments of hemispheric language dominance
	in each of the seven patients. These results suggest that, in addition
	to providing a tool for investigating human cognitive processes,
	fMRI has significant clinical potential as a non-invasive measure
	of language lateralization.},

	Consciousness was never impaired during these events. A multislice
	echoplanar technique was used to acquire 16 contiguous axial slices

	the posterior left frontal lobe, which correlated well both in duration

	by invasive electrophysiological monitoring. The spatial localization
	of fMRI was more accurate than electroencephalography recorded from
	a subdural grid in predicting the site of successful surgical therapy.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To use fMRI to investigate whether hippocampal and entorhinal
	activation during learning is altered in the earliest phase of mild
	cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Three groups of older individuals
	were studied: 10 cognitively intact controls, 9 individuals at the
	mild end of the spectrum of MCI, and 10 patients with probable Alzheimer
	disease (AD). Subjects performed a face-name associative encoding
	task during fMRI scanning, and were tested for recognition of stimuli
	afterward. Data were analyzed using a functional-anatomic method
	in which medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions of interest were identified
	from each individual's structural MRI, and fMRI activation was quantified
	within each region. RESULTS: Significantly greater hippocampal activation
	was present in the MCI group compared to controls; there were no
	differences between these two groups in hippocampal or entorhinal
	volumes. In contrast, the AD group showed hippocampal and entorhinal
	hypoactivation and atrophy in comparison to controls. The subjects
	with MCI performed similarly to controls on the fMRI recognition
	memory task; patients with AD exhibited poorer performance. Across
	all 29 subjects, greater mean entorhinal activation was found in
	the subgroup of 13 carriers of the APOE epsilon4 allele than in the
	16 noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: The authors hypothesize that there is
	a phase of increased medial temporal lobe activation early in the

	Abstract = {The pathophysiologic process leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's
	disease (AD) is thought to begin long before clinical symptoms develop.
	Existing therapeutics for AD improve symptoms, but increasing efforts
	are being directed toward the development of therapies to impede
	the pathologic progression of the disease. Although these medications
	must ultimately demonstrate efficacy in slowing clinical decline,
	there is a critical need for biomarkers that will indicate whether
	a candidate disease-modifying therapeutic agent is actually altering
	the underlying degenerative process. A number of in vivo neuroimaging
	techniques, which can reliably and noninvasively assess aspects of
	neuroanatomy, chemistry, physiology, and pathology, hold promise
	as biomarkers. These neuroimaging measures appear to relate closely
	to neuropathological and clinical data, such as rate of cognitive
	decline and risk of future decline. As this work has matured, it
	has become clear that neuroimaging measures may serve a variety of
	potential roles in clinical trials of candidate neurotherapeutic
	agents for AD, depending in part on the question of interest and
	phase of drug development. In this article, we review data related
	to the range of neuroimaging biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease and
	consider potential applications of these techniques to clinical trials,

	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Abnormal neurodevelopment may play a role
	in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We used deformation-based
	morphometry to examine voxel-wise age-related changes in patients
	with schizophrenia compared with healthy brains. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
	We used a set of skull-stripped brains from an image database of
	cranial magnetic resonance images. We then deformed a template brain
	to the rest of the brains creating a set of deformation fields. Using
	the Jacobian values of these deformation fields, we calculated the
	voxel-wise t-score for comparison of controls with patients. We also
	calculated the voxel-wise Pearson correlation of Jacobian with age
	for both controls and patients. RESULTS: By examining the volume
	renderings of these statistical fields, we found that healthy people
	undergo age-related expansion of the ventricles, the surrounding
	periventricular white matter, and a corresponding decline in the
	frontal lobes and cingulate gyrus. In contrast, patients show much
	less of this age-related expansion of the ventricles and less atrophy
	in the cerebral cortex. In addition, patients have larger ventricles
	and reduced volume in the frontal/parietal lobes. CONCLUSION: These
	constellations of findings suggest that otherwise normal age-related
	ventricular enlargement and cortical loss occurs in schizophrenia
	patients, albeit at an earlier age.},

	on the reference can then be propagated back on the new volume instance,
	thereby achieving segmentation. The proposed method was tested on
	a data set of 80 normal subjects and compared against manual segmentation
	as well as automated segmentation results from ANIMAL, a nonlinear
	registration and segmentation technique. Experimental results demonstrated
	the robustness and flexibility of the new method. Segmentation accuracy,

	in Alzheimer disease (AD) measured by [11C]PIB-PET, regional cerebral
	glucose metabolism (rCMRGlc) measured by [18F]FDG-PET, and cognition.
	METHODS: Nineteen subjects with AD and 14 controls had [11C]PIB-PET
	and underwent a battery of psychometric tests. Twelve of those subjects
	with AD and eight controls had [18F]FDG-PET. Parametric images of
	[11C]PIB binding and rCMRGlc were interrogated with a region-of-interest
	atlas and statistical parametric mapping. [11C]PIB binding and rCMRGlc
	were correlated with scores on psychometric tests. RESULTS: AD subjects
	showed twofold increases in mean [11C]PIB binding in cingulate, frontal,
	temporal, parietal, and occipital cortical areas. Higher cortical
	amyloid load correlated with lower scores on facial and word recognition
	tests. Two patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for AD had normal
	[11C]PIB at baseline. Over 20 months this remained normal in one
	but increased in the cingulate of the other. Mean levels of temporal
	and parietal rCMRGlc were reduced by 20\% in AD and these correlated
	with mini mental scores, immediate recall, and recognition memory
	test for words. Higher [11C]PIB uptake correlated with lower rCMRGlc
	in temporal and parietal cortices. CONCLUSION: [11C]PIB-PET detected
	an increased amyloid plaque load in 89\% of patients with clinically
	probable Alzheimer disease (AD). The high frontal amyloid load detected
	by [11C]PIB-PET in AD in the face of spared glucose metabolism is
	of interest and suggests that amyloid plaque formation may not be

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Velocardiofacial syndrome is a common genetic condition
	often accompanied by mild cognitive impairment. Children and adolescents
	with velocardiofacial syndrome also are at greater risk for developing
	serious neuropsychiatric disorders in adulthood, particularly schizophrenia-like
	disorders. The purpose of this preliminary study was to 1) elucidate
	through brain imaging the neurobiological basis of cognitive and
	neuropsychiatric problems in velocardiofacial syndrome, and 2) consider
	the association between variations in neuroanatomy in velocardiofacial
	syndrome subjects and the associated neurobehavioral phenotype. METHOD:
	Fifteen children and adolescents with velocardiofacial syndrome were
	matched by age and gender with 15 comparison subjects. High-resolution
	magnetic resonance imaging scans were analyzed to provide quantitative
	measures of specified brain tissues and regions. Rater-blind morphometric
	analyses were conducted to examine tissue volumes of the four lobes
	and the cerebellum. RESULTS: Total brain volume was approximately
	11\% smaller in the children with velocardiofacial syndrome. Gray
	matter volume was reduced to a lesser extent (7.5\%) than white matter
	volume (16.3\%). Multivariate analyses of variance indicated a distinct
	pattern of regional morphological variation among the children with
	velocardiofacial syndrome. Specifically, frontal lobe tissue tended
	to be enlarged relative to the overall reduction in brain volume.
	Normal symmetry of parietal lobe tissue observed in the comparison
	group was not evident in the velocardiofacial syndrome group. This
	loss of symmetry was attributable to a significant reduction of gray
	matter in the left parietal lobe. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant brain morphology
	is associated with velocardiofacial syndrome. These changes are potentially
	related to the language and learning deficits associated with the
	syndrome and may provide clues about neurodevelopmental pathways
	associated with schizophrenia.},

	with partial seizures and MCD, with 30 control subjects. Whole-brain
	DTI was acquired using echo planar imaging. Rotationally invariant
	anisotropy and diffusivity maps were calculated and, after normalization
	to Talairach space, each patient was compared with the group of control
	subjects using SPM. Areas of reduced anisotropy were found in 17
	patients and areas of increased diffusivity in 10. Two patients had
	areas of increased anisotropy. There were no patients with reduced
	diffusivity. Areas of increased diffusivity were in general more
	extensive than areas of reduced anisotropy. Changes in tissue beyond
	the MCD, that appeared normal on conventional MRI, were found in
	six patients for anisotropy and nine patients for diffusivity. Both
	measurements showed widespread changes in tissue beyond the MCD,
	i.e. adding information to conventional MRI. Increased or abnormally
	located grey matter or pathological white matter with abnormal myelination
	or ectopic neurones could cause reduced anisotropy. Increased diffusivity
	could be caused by a defect of neurogenesis or cell loss resulting
	in increased extracellular space. The widespread nature of abnormalities
	should be considered if surgical treatment is contemplated.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The laminar patterns displayed by MR microscopy
	(MRM) form one basis for the classification of the cytoarchitectonic
	areas (Brodmann areas). It is plausible that in the future MRM may
	depict Brodmann areas directly, and not only by inference from gross
	anatomic location. Our purpose was to depict the laminar cytoarchitecture
	of excised, formalin-fixed specimens of human cerebral cortex by
	use of 9.4-T MR and to correlate MR images with histologic stains
	of the same sections. METHODS: Formalin-fixed samples of human sensory
	isocortex (calcarine, Heschl's, and somatosensory cortices), motor
	isocortex (hand motor area of M1), polar isocortex (frontal pole),
	allocortex (hippocampal formation), and transitional periallocortex
	(retrosplenial cortex) were studied by MRM at 9.4 T with intermediate-weighted
	pulse sequences for a total overnight acquisition time of 14 hours
	17 minutes for each specimen. The same samples were then histologically
	analyzed to confirm the MR identification of the cortical layers.
	Curves representing the change in MR signal intensity across the
	cortex were generated to display the signal intensity profiles for
	each type of cortex. RESULTS: High-field-strength MR imaging at a
	spatial resolution of 78 x 78 x 500 micro m resolves the horizontal
	lamination of isocortex, allocortex, and periallocortex and displays
	specific intracortical structures such as the external band of Baillarger.
	The signal intensity profiles demonstrate the greatest hypointensity
	at the sites of maximum myelin concentration and maximum cell density
	and show gradations of signal intensity inversely proportional to
	varying cell density. CONCLUSION: MRM at 9.4 T depicts important
	aspects of the cytoarchitecture of normal formalin-fixed human cortex.},

	Abstract = {A primary goal of statistical shape analysis is to describe the variability
	of a population of geometric objects. A standard technique for computing
	such descriptions is principal component analysis. However, principal
	component analysis is limited in that it only works for data lying
	in a Euclidean vector space. While this is certainly sufficient for
	geometric models that are parameterized by a set of landmarks or
	a dense collection of boundary points, it does not handle more complex
	representations of shape. We have been developing representations
	of geometry based on the medial axis description or m-rep. While
	the medial representation provides a rich language for variability
	in terms of bending, twisting, and widening, the medial parameters
	are not elements of a Euclidean vector space. They are in fact elements
	of a nonlinear Riemannian symmetric space. In this paper, we develop
	the method of principal geodesic analysis, a generalization of principal
	component analysis to the manifold setting. We demonstrate its use
	in describing the variability of medially-defined anatomical objects.

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a technique capable of
	examining water diffusion in different tissues and the organisation
	of white matter tracts, was used to investigate the neuropathology
	of the corpus callosum in vivo in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS:
	Diffusion tensor imaging was performed in 20 schizophrenic patients
	and 25 healthy controls. Two complementary measures, mean diffusivity
	and fractional anisotropy, which are considered to be sensitive indices
	of axonal integrity, were obtained from regions of interest in the
	genu (anterior) and splenium (posterior) of the corpus callosum.
	RESULTS: Mean diffusivity was significantly increased and fractional
	anisotropy significantly reduced in the splenium but not the genu
	of the corpus callosum in the schizophrenic group compared with controls.
	There were no significant sex differences in the DTI measures for
	either the schizophrenic or control group. Clinical variables such
	as age, duration of illness, dose of antipsychotic medication, and
	schizophrenic symptoms did not predict the DTI changes in the schizophrenic
	patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of DTI changes in the splenium
	but not the genu of the corpus callosum suggests that there may be
	a focal disruption of commisural connectivity in schizophrenia. However,
	these findings do not exclude the possibility of abnormalities in
	other areas of the corpus callosum or other regions of white matter
	and further research using different methods of analysis may enable
	us to clarify this. Diffusion tensor imaging is a valuable tool in
	investigating the structure of white matter in schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is characterized

	postmortem studies indicate that multiple neuropathological entities

	predict the underlying pathology. METHODS: A clinicopathological
	correlation was performed on 90 consecutive patients with a pathological
	diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and was compared with an additional
	24 cases accrued during the same time period with a clinical diagnosis
	of FTLD, but with pathology not typically associated with frontotemporal
	dementia. RESULTS: Postmortem examination showed multiple pathologies
	including tauopathies (46\%), FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	(29\%), and Alzheimer's disease (17\%). The pathological groups manifested
	some distinct demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological features,
	although these attributes showed only a statistical association with
	the underlying pathology. FTLD with ubiquitin-positive inclusions
	was more likely to present with both social and language dysfunction,
	and motor neuron disease was more likely to emerge in these patients.
	Tauopathies were more commonly associated with an extrapyramidal
	disorder. Alzheimer's disease was associated with relatively greater
	deficits in memory and executive function. INTERPRETATION: Clinical
	and neuropsychological features contribute to delineating the spectrum

	are needed that, together with the clinical phenotype, can predict

	cerebral atrophy that may be measured using MRI. Reported are MRI
	findings of a Phase IIa immunotherapy trial in AD prematurely terminated

	To assess cerebral volume changes in patients immunized with AN1792
	(beta-amyloid [Abeta] 1 to 42) who were antibody responders (anti-AN1792
	IgG titer of > or =1:2,200) compared with placebo patients. METHODS:
	This randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
	of AN1792 225 mug plus QS-21 50 mug included 372 patients with probable
	AD. Patients received one to three injections of AN1792/QS-21 or
	saline and were assessed for 12 months. Volumetric MRI was performed
	pre dose and at month 12 or early termination. Brain, ventricular,
	and hippocampal volume changes were measured from registered scan
	pairs. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-eight patients had paired scans
	(mean interval 10.9 months). Antibody responders (n = 45) had greater
	brain volume decrease (3.12 +/- 1.98 vs 2.04 +/- 1.74\%; p = 0.007),
	greater ventricular enlargement as a percentage of baseline brain
	volume (1.10 +/- 0.75 vs 0.48 +/- 0.40\%; p < 0.001), and a nonsignificant
	greater hippocampal volume decrease (3.78 +/- 2.63 vs 2.86 +/- 3.19\%;
	p = 0.124) than placebo patients (n = 57). Increased losses in brain
	volume were not reflected in worsening cognitive performance; a composite
	z score across a Neuropsychological Test Battery showed differences
	favoring antibody responders over placebo (0.03 +/- 0.39 vs -0.24
	+/- 0.45; p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: A dissociation between brain volume
	loss and cognitive function was observed in AN1792/QS-21 antibody
	responders. The reasons for this remain unclear but include the possibility
	that volume changes were due to amyloid removal and associated cerebral
	fluid shifts.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe atrophic changes of the hippocampus and entorhinal
	cortex in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and compare them with those
	of AD. BACKGROUND: The medial temporal lobe shows atrophic changes
	early in the course of AD, but whether these changes are specific
	to AD or occur in other degenerative dementias, and to what extent,
	is unclear. METHODS: The authors measured the volumes of the left
	and right hippocampus and entorhinal cortex from MR images (1.5 T,
	2-mm-thick slices) in 12 patients with FTD, 30 with AD, and 30 elderly
	control subjects. RESULTS: In FTD patients, the left and right hippocampus
	(16\% and 21\% tissue loss) and the entorhinal cortex (28\% and 27\%
	loss) were more atrophic than the control subjects. Atrophy of the
	hippocampus in FTD was less severe than in AD, but atrophy of the
	entorhinal cortex was equally severe. Greater hippocampal and entorhinal
	cortex atrophy was present in the most severe patients in both groups
	(as high as a 49\% tissue loss). The sensitivity of the hippocampus
	and the entorhinal cortex to discriminate FTD patients from control
	subjects was low (49\% and 52\%, respectively; specificity set at
	90\%), whereas hippocampal volumes could better differentiate AD
	patients from control subjects (80\% sensitivity). CONCLUSIONS: At
	variance with AD, detectable in vivo atrophy of the hippocampus might
	not be an early event in FTD. Differential patterns of atrophy might
	help in the diagnostic process of the degenerative dementias.},

@article{friston02,
	Abstract = {In Friston et al. ((2002) Neuroimage 16: 465-483) we introduced empirical
	Bayes as a potentially useful way to estimate and make inferences
	about effects in hierarchical models. In this paper we present a
	series of models that exemplify the diversity of problems that can
	be addressed within this framework. In hierarchical linear observation
	models, both classical and empirical Bayesian approaches can be framed
	in terms of covariance component estimation (e.g., variance partitioning).
	To illustrate the use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm
	in covariance component estimation we focus first on two important
	problems in fMRI: nonsphericity induced by (i) serial or temporal
	correlations among errors and (ii) variance components caused by
	the hierarchical nature of multisubject studies. In hierarchical
	observation models, variance components at higher levels can be used
	as constraints on the parameter estimates of lower levels. This enables
	the use of parametric empirical Bayesian (PEB) estimators, as distinct
	from classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimates. We develop this
	distinction to address: (i) The difference between response estimates
	based on ML and the conditional means from a Bayesian approach and
	the implications for estimates of intersubject variability. (ii)
	The relationship between fixed- and random-effect analyses. (iii)
	The specificity and sensitivity of Bayesian inference and, finally,
	(iv) the relative importance of the number of scans and subjects.
	The forgoing is concerned with within- and between-subject variability
	in multisubject hierarchical fMRI studies. In the second half of
	this paper we turn to Bayesian inference at the first (within-voxel)
	level, using PET data to show how priors can be derived from the
	(between-voxel) distribution of activations over the brain. This
	application uses exactly the same ideas and formalism but, in this
	instance, the second level is provided by observations over voxels
	as opposed to subjects. The ensuing posterior probability maps (PPMs)
	have enhanced anatomical precision and greater face validity, in
	relation to underlying anatomy. Furthermore, in comparison to conventional
	SPMs they are not confounded by the multiple comparison problem that,
	in a classical context, dictates high thresholds and low sensitivity.
	We conclude with some general comments on Bayesian approaches to
	image analysis and on some unresolved issues.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: fMRI language tasks readily identify frontal language
	areas; temporal activation has been less consistent. No studies have
	compared clinical visual judgment to quantitative region of interest
	(ROI) analysis. OBJECTIVE: To identify temporal language areas in
	patients with partial epilepsy using a reading paradigm with clinical
	and ROI interpretation. METHODS: Thirty patients with temporal lobe
	epilepsy, aged 8 to 56 years, had 1.5-T fMRI. Patients silently named
	an object described by a sentence compared to a visual control. Data
	were analyzed with ROI analysis from t-maps. Regional asymmetry indices
	(AI) were calculated ([L-R]/[L+R]) and language dominance defined
	as >0.20. t-Maps were visually rated by three readers at three t
	thresholds. Twenty-one patients had intracarotid amobarbital test
	(IAT). RESULTS: The fMRI reading task provided evidence of language
	lateralization in 27 of 30 patients with ROI analysis. Twenty-five
	were left dominant, two right, one bilateral, and two were nondiagnostic;
	IAT and fMRI agreed in most patients, three had partial agreement,
	none overtly disagreed. Interrater agreement ranged between 0.77
	to 0.82 (Cramer V; p < 0.0001); agreement between visual and ROI
	reading with IAT was 0.71 to 0.77 (Cramer V; p < 0.0001). Viewing
	data at lower thresholds added interpretation to 12 patients on visual

	can identify language dominance in frontal and temporal areas. Clinical
	visual interpretation is comparable to quantitative ROI analysis.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize and quantify the patterns of temporal lobe
	atrophy in AD vs semantic dementia and to relate the findings to
	the cognitive profiles. Medial temporal lobe atrophy is well described
	in AD. In temporal variant frontotemporal dementia (semantic dementia),
	clinical studies suggest polar and inferolateral temporal atrophy
	with hippocampal sparing, but quantification is largely lacking.
	METHODS: A volumetric method for quantifying multiple temporal structures
	was applied to 26 patients with probable AD, 18 patients with semantic
	dementia, and 21 matched control subjects. RESULTS: The authors confirmed
	the expected bilateral hippocampal atrophy in AD relative to controls,
	with involvement of the amygdala bilaterally and the right parahippocampal
	gyrus. Contrary to expectations, patients with semantic dementia
	had asymmetric hippocampal atrophy, more extensive than AD on the
	left. As predicted, the semantic dementia group showed more severe
	involvement of the temporal pole bilaterally and the left amygdala,
	parahippocampal gyrus (including the entorhinal cortex), fusiform
	gyrus, and the inferior and middle temporal gyri. Performance on
	semantic association tasks correlated with the size of the left fusiform
	gyrus, whereas naming appeared to depend upon a wider left temporal
	network. Episodic memory measures, with the exception of recognition
	memory for faces, did not correlate with temporal measures. CONCLUSIONS:
	Hippocampal atrophy is not specific for AD but is also seen in semantic
	dementia. Distinguishing the patients with semantic dementia was
	the severe global but asymmetric (left > right) atrophy of the amygdala,
	temporal pole, and fusiform and inferolateral temporal gyri. These
	findings have implications for diagnosis and understanding of the
	cognitive deficits in AD and semantic dementia.},

	computed tomography (SPECT) measures of regional cerebral blood flow
	(rCBF) were obtained during a verbal recognition memory task in nine
	subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease and 10 elderly healthy controls.
	Using the statistical parametric mapping approach, voxel based comparisons
	were made on the MRI data to identify clusters of significantly reduced
	grey matter concentrations in the hippocampal region in the Alzheimer
	patients relative to the controls. The mean grey matter density in
	the voxel cluster of greatest hippocampal atrophy was extracted for
	each Alzheimer subject. This measure was used to investigate, on
	a voxel by voxel basis, the presence of significant correlations
	between the degree of hippocampal atrophy and the rCBF SPECT measures
	obtained during the memory task. RESULTS: Direct correlations were
	detected between the hippocampal grey matter density and rCBF values

	in the left medial temporal region, and in the left posterior cingulate
	cortex during the memory task in the Alzheimer's disease group (p

	Abstract = {Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics
	derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem.
	With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some
	correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates,
	but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni)
	tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This
	paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures
	for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical
	work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will
	be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures
	operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine
	which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation
	of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of
	the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate
	this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hypergraph skeletal representation for
	3D shape based on a formal derivation of the generic structure of
	its medial axis. By classifying each skeletal point by its order
	of contact, we show that, generically, the medial axis consists of
	five types of points, which are then organized into sheets, curves,
	and points: 1) sheets (manifolds with boundary) which are the locus
	of bitangent spheres with regular tangency A1(2) (Ak(n) notation
	means n distinct k-fold tangencies of the sphere of contact, as explained
	in the text); two types of curves, 2) the intersection curve of three
	sheets and the locus of centers of tritangent spheres, A1(3), and
	3) the boundary of sheets, which are the locus of centers of spheres
	whose radius equals the larger principal curvature, i.e., higher
	order contact A3 points; and two types of points, 4) centers of quad-tangent
	spheres, A1(4), and 5) centers of spheres with one regular tangency
	and one higher order tangency, A1A3. The geometry of the 3D medial
	axis thus consists of sheets (A1(2)) bounded by one type of curve
	(A3) on their free end, which corresponds to ridges on the surface,
	and attached to two other sheets at another type of curve (A1(3)),
	which support a generalized cylinder description. The A3 curves can
	only end in A1A3 points where they must meet an A1(3) curve. The
	A1(3) curves meet together in fours at an A1(4) point. This formal
	result leads to a compact representation for 3D shape, referred to
	as the medial axis hypergraph representation consisting of nodes
	(A1(4) and A1A3 points), links between pairs of nodes (A1(3) and
	A3 curves) and hyperlinks between groups of links (A1(2) sheets).
	The description of the local geometry at nodes by itself is sufficient
	to capture qualitative aspects of shapes, in analogy to 2D. We derive
	a pointwise reconstruction formula to reconstruct a surface from
	this medial axis hypergraph together with the radius function. Thus,
	this information completely characterizes 3D shape and lays the theoretical
	foundation for its use in recognition, morphing, design, and manipulation
	of shapes.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in arousal and their impact on memory
	performance during the intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT). METHODS:
	Along with memory measures, level of arousal was evaluated through
	clinical ratings and nonverbal self-ratings in epilepsy patients
	undergoing IAT before anterior temporal lobectomy. RESULTS: Irrespective
	of seizure focus, left-sided amobarbital injection resulted in decreased
	objective and subjective arousal more often than right-side injection.
	Impaired objective arousal was greater when the left hemisphere was
	injected second, because of the presumed additive effects of systemic
	amobarbital residual from the first injection. Decreased objective
	arousal was related to poorer performance on memory testing following
	left-hemisphere injection. CONCLUSIONS: The IAT, as practiced in
	most centers, is biased, so patients with right temporal lobe seizure
	focus are more likely to "pass" the test, whereas patients with left
	seizure focus are more likely to "fail" the test. The significant
	impact of changes in arousal on memory testing needs to be considered
	when using IAT results to select patients for temporal lobectomy.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the utility of functional magnetic resonance
	imaging (fMRI) in preoperative lateralization of memory function
	in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). METHODS: Nine
	patients with MTLE underwent standard preoperative assessment including
	video-EEG and intracarotid amytal testing (IAT). fMRI was performed
	while subjects encoded four types of stimuli (patterns, faces, scenes,
	and words). Activation maps were created for each subject representing
	areas more active for novel than for repeated stimuli. Regions of
	interest were drawn around the MTL in individual subjects, suprathreshold
	voxels were counted, and an asymmetry index was calculated. RESULTS:
	In eight of nine subjects, lateralization of memory encoding by fMRI
	was concordant with that obtained from the IAT. Group-level analysis
	demonstrated greater activation in the MTL contralateral to the seizure
	focus such that in the left MTLE group, verbal encoding engaged the
	right MTL, whereas in the right MTLE group, nonverbal encoding engaged
	the left MTL. CONCLUSIONS: fMRI is a valid tool for assessing of
	memory lateralization in patients with MTLE and may therefore allow
	noninvasive preoperative evaluation of memory lateralization. FMRI
	revealed that memory encoding may be reorganized to the contralateral

	Abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a unique source of information
	about the underlying tissue structure of brain white matter in vivo
	including both the geometry of major fiber bundles as well as quantitative
	information about tissue properties represented by derived tensor
	measures. This paper presents a method for statistical comparison
	of fiber bundle diffusion properties between populations of diffusion
	tensor images. Unbiased diffeomorphic atlas building is used to compute
	a normalized coordinate system for populations of diffusion images.
	The diffeomorphic transformations between each subject and the atlas
	provide spatial normalization for the comparison of tract statistics.
	Diffusion properties, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and tensor
	norm, along fiber tracts are modeled as multivariate functions of
	arc length. Hypothesis testing is performed non-parametrically using
	permutation testing based on the Hotelling T(2) statistic. The linear
	discriminant embedded in the T(2) metric provides an intuitive, localized
	interpretation of detected differences. The proposed methodology
	was tested on two clinical studies of neurodevelopment. In a study
	of 1 and 2 year old subjects, a significant increase in FA and a
	correlated decrease in Frobenius norm was found in several tracts.
	Significant differences in neonates were found in the splenium tract
	between controls and subjects with isolated mild ventriculomegaly
	(MVM) demonstrating the potential of this method for clinical studies.},

	Abstract = {Several groups have developed methods for registering an individual's
	3D MRI by deforming a standard template. This achievement leads to
	many possibilities for segmentation and morphology that will impact
	nuclear medical research in areas such as activation and receptor
	studies. Accordingly, there is a need for methods that can assess
	the accuracy of intersubject registration. We have developed a method
	based on a set of 128 anatomic landmarks per hemisphere, both cortical
	and subcortical, that allows assessment of both global and local
	transformation accuracy. We applied our method to compare the accuracy
	of two standard methods of intersubject registration, AIR 3.0 with
	fifth-order polynomial warping and the Talairach stereotaxic transformation
	(Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). SPGR MRI's (256 x 256 x 160) of six
	normal subjects (age 18-24 years) were derformed to match a standard
	template volume. To assess registration accuracy the landmarks were
	located on both the template volume and the transformed volumes by
	an experienced neuroanatomist. The resulting list of coordinates
	was analyzed graphically and by ANOVA to compare the accuracy of
	the two methods and the results of the manual analysis. ANOVA performed
	over all 128 landmarks showed that the Woods method was more accurate
	than Talairach (left hemisphere F = 2.8, P < 0.001 and right hemisphere
	F =2.4, P < 0.006). The Woods method provided a better brain surface
	transformation than did Talairach (F = 18.0, P < 0.0001), but as
	expected there was a smaller difference for subcortical structures
	and both had an accuracy <1 mm for the majority of subcortical landmarks.
	Overall, both the Woods and Talairach method located about 70\% of
	landmarks with an error of 3 mm or less. More striking differences
	were noted for landmark accuracy </=1 mm, where the Woods method
	located about 40\% and Talairach about 23\%. These results demonstrate
	that this anatomically based assessment method can help evaluate
	new methods of intersubject registration and should be a helpful
	tool in appreciating regional differences in accuracy. Consistent
	with expectation, we confirmed that the Woods nonlinear registration
	method was more accurate than Talairach. Landmark-based anatomic
	analyses of intersubject registration accuracy offer opportunities
	to explore the relationship among structure, function and architectonic
	boundaries in the human brain.},

	Abstract = {In this study, a novel partially parallel acquisition (PPA) method
	is presented which can be used to accelerate image acquisition using
	an RF coil array for spatial encoding. This technique, GeneRalized
	Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) is an extension
	of both the PILS and VD-AUTO-SMASH reconstruction techniques. As
	in those previous methods, a detailed, highly accurate RF field map
	is not needed prior to reconstruction in GRAPPA. This information
	is obtained from several k-space lines which are acquired in addition
	to the normal image acquisition. As in PILS, the GRAPPA reconstruction
	algorithm provides unaliased images from each component coil prior
	to image combination. This results in even higher SNR and better
	image quality since the steps of image reconstruction and image combination
	are performed in separate steps. After introducing the GRAPPA technique,
	primary focus is given to issues related to the practical implementation
	of GRAPPA, including the reconstruction algorithm as well as analysis
	of SNR in the resulting images. Finally, in vivo GRAPPA images are
	shown which demonstrate the utility of the technique.},

	clinicians to identify individual white matter fiber tracts and map
	their trajectories. The reliability and interpretability of fiber-tracking
	procedures is improved when a priori anatomical information is used
	as a guide. We have developed an automated method for labeling white
	matter fiber tracts in individual subjects based on a probabilistic
	atlas of fiber tract locations and orientations. The probabilistic
	fiber atlas contains 23 fiber tracts and was constructed by manually
	identifying fiber tracts in 21 healthy controls and 21 patients with
	temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The manual tract identification method
	required approximately 40 h of manual editing by a trained image
	analyst using multiple regions of interest to select or exclude streamline
	fibers. Identification of fiber tracts with the atlas does not require
	human intervention, but nonetheless benefits from the a priori anatomical
	information that was used to manually identify the tracts included
	in the atlas. We applied this method to compare fractional anisotropy-thought
	to be a measure of white matter integrity-in individual fiber tracts
	between control subjects and patients with TLE. We found that the
	atlas-based and manual fiber selection methods produced a similar
	pattern of results. However, the between-group effect sizes using
	the atlas-derived fibers were generally as large or larger than those
	obtained with manually selected fiber tracks. Hum Brain Mapp, 2008.

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: While the neuroanatomical basis of autism is not yet known,
	evidence suggests that brain enlargement may be characteristic of
	this disorder. Inferences about the timing of brain enlargement have
	recently come from studies of head circumference (HC). OBJECTIVES:
	To examine brain volume and HC in individuals with autism as compared
	with control individuals. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of brain
	volume was conducted at the first time point in an ongoing longitudinal
	magnetic resonance imaging study of brain development in autism.
	Retrospective longitudinal HC measurements were gathered from medical
	records on a larger sample of individuals with autism and local control
	individuals. SETTING: Clinical research center. PARTICIPANTS: The
	magnetic resonance imaging study included 51 children with autism
	and 25 control children between 18 and 35 months of age (the latter
	included both developmentally delayed and typically developing children).
	Retrospective, longitudinal HC data were examined from birth to age
	3 years in 113 children with autism and 189 local control children.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cerebral cortical (including cortical lobes)
	and cerebellar gray and white matter magnetic resonance imaging brain
	volumes as well as retrospective HC data from medical records were
	studied. RESULTS: Significant enlargement was detected in cerebral
	cortical volumes but not cerebellar volumes in individuals with autism.
	Enlargement was present in both white and gray matter, and it was
	generalized throughout the cerebral cortex. Head circumference appears
	normal at birth, with a significantly increased rate of HC growth
	appearing to begin around 12 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Generalized
	enlargement of gray and white matter cerebral volumes, but not cerebellar
	volumes, are present at 2 years of age in autism. Indirect evidence
	suggests that this increased rate of brain growth in autism may have
	its onset postnatally in the latter part of the first year of life.},

	Abstract = {Regions in three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) brain images
	can be classified using protocols for manually segmenting and labeling
	structures. For large cohorts, time and expertise requirements make
	this approach impractical. To achieve automation, an individual segmentation
	can be propagated to another individual using an anatomical correspondence
	estimate relating the atlas image to the target image. The accuracy
	of the resulting target labeling has been limited but can potentially
	be improved by combining multiple segmentations using decision fusion.
	We studied segmentation propagation and decision fusion on 30 normal
	brain MR images, which had been manually segmented into 67 structures.
	Correspondence estimates were established by nonrigid registration
	using free-form deformations. Both direct label propagation and an
	indirect approach were tested. Individual propagations showed an
	average similarity index (SI) of 0.754+/-0.016 against manual segmentations.
	Decision fusion using 29 input segmentations increased SI to 0.836+/-0.009.
	For indirect propagation of a single source via 27 intermediate images,
	SI was 0.779+/-0.013. We also studied the effect of the decision
	fusion procedure using a numerical simulation with synthetic input
	data. The results helped to formulate a model that predicts the quality
	improvement of fused brain segmentations based on the number of individual
	propagated segmentations combined. We demonstrate a practicable procedure

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the accuracy and repeatability of a semiautomatic
	segmentation algorithm with those of manual segmentation for determining
	liver volume in living liver transplant donors at magnetic resonance
	(MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board
	approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for
	informed consent. The semiautomatic segmentation algorithm is based
	on geometric deformable models and the level-set technique. It entails
	(a) placing initialization circle(s) on each image section, (b) running
	the algorithm, (c) inspecting and possibly manually modifying the
	contours obtained with the segmentation algorithm, and (d) placing
	lines to separate the liver segments. For 18 living donors (eight
	men and 10 women; mean age, 34 years; age range, 25-46 years), two
	observers each performed two semiautomatic and two manual segmentations
	on contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted MR images. Each measurement
	was timed. Actual graft weight was measured during surgery. The time
	needed for manual and that needed for semiautomatic segmentation
	were compared. Accuracy and repeatability were evaluated with the
	Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: Mean interaction time was reduced from
	25 minutes with manual segmentation to 5 minutes with semiautomatic
	segmentation. The mean total time for the semiautomatic process was
	7 minutes 20 seconds. Differences between the actual volume and the
	estimated volume ranged from -223 to +123 mL for manual segmentation
	and from -214 to +86 mL for semiautomatic segmentation. The 95\%
	limits of agreement for the ratio of actual graft volume to estimated
	graft volume were 0.686 and 1.601 for semiautomatic segmentation
	and 0.651 and 1.957 for manual segmentation. Semiautomatic segmentation
	improved estimation in 15 of 18 cases. Inter- and intraobserver repeatability
	was higher with semiautomatic segmentation. CONCLUSION: Use of the
	semiautomatic segmentation algorithm substantially reduces the time
	needed for volumetric measurement of liver segments while improving

	assessed whether higher-field MR imaging offers higher or lower power
	to detect longitudinal changes in the brain, using tensor-based morphometry
	(TBM) to reveal the location of progressive atrophy. As expected,
	at both field strengths, progressive atrophy was widespread in AD
	and more spatially restricted in MCI. Power analysis revealed that,
	to detect a 25\% slowing of atrophy (with 80\% power), 37 AD and
	108 MCI subjects would be needed at 1.5 T versus 49 AD and 166 MCI
	subjects at 3 T; however, the increased power at 1.5 T was not statistically

	Using MRI-based large-deformation high-dimensional mapping (HDM-LD),
	which allows structural evaluation of regions of the hippocampus,
	we document the HDM-LD-defined pattern of hippocampal deformation
	in MTLE patients compared with matched controls. In 30 subjects with
	MTLE and confirmed medial temporal lobe sclerosis (MTS), we performed
	measurements of intracranial area, brain parenchymal volume and deformation-based
	hippocampal segmentations, and then grouped patients into right and
	left MTS groups (resulting in 15 subjects in each group). Using HDM-LD
	techniques, we compared the right and left MTS groups with a group
	of 15 matched controls. Analysis included both the MTS and contralateral
	hippocampi, and covariance for changes in brain parenchymal volume.
	Final results were interpreted using a segmentation showing normal
	hippocampal surface subfield anatomy. Comparing the MTS groups with
	controls, after covarying with brain parenchymal volume, the MTS
	hippocampi showed significant volume loss (P < 0.0001), contralateral
	hippocampi showed no significant volume loss. HDM-LD techniques showed
	significant shape changes, with marked inward deviation in the Sommer
	sector of the MTS hippocampi. In the contralateral hippocampi, the
	inferior surface of the hippocampal body showed inward deformation
	in the medial aspect of the subiculum, with minimal involvement of
	the Sommer sector. HDM-LD shows involvement of subregions of the
	hippocampus which are consistent with MTS histopathology. Contralateral
	hippocampi show different HDM-LD changes, suggesting that the underlying
	disease process in the contralateral hippocampi is different from
	MTS.},

	hippocampal volume differences on MRI between normal aging, cognitive

	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reliability was determined for an automatic
	and a manual method on nine volunteers (22-83 years old) who underwent
	MRI twice in 1 day. Hippocampal volumes of 20 cognitively normal
	subjects (mean age 74.0 +/- 6.2 years) and age-matched patients (20
	CI and 20 AD) were compared. RESULTS: The intraclass correlation
	for automatic calculations of hippocampal volume was 0.94; for manual
	tracing it was 0.99. Volume differences between cognitively normal,
	CI, and AD subjects from the automatic and manual methods were similar.
	CONCLUSION: Because the automatic calculations were faster and less
	susceptible to rater bias than manual tracing, this automated method
	is expected to be very useful for analyzing hippocampal changes in

	Abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an exciting new MRI modality that
	can reveal detailed anatomy of the white matter. DTI also allows
	us to approximate the 3D trajectories of major white matter bundles.
	By combining the identified tract coordinates with various types

	perform tract-specific analysis of these parameters. Unfortunately,
	3D tract reconstruction is marred by noise, partial volume effects,
	and complicated axonal structures. Furthermore, changes in diffusion
	anisotropy under pathological conditions could alter the results
	of 3D tract reconstruction. In this study, we created a white matter

	Using these probabilistic maps, automated tract-specific quantification

	Abstract = {Tensor-based morphometry (TBM) is a powerful method to map the 3D
	profile of brain degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild
	cognitive impairment (MCI). We optimized a TBM-based image analysis
	method to determine what methodological factors, and which image-derived
	measures, maximize statistical power to track brain change. 3D maps,
	tracking rates of structural atrophy over time, were created from
	1030 longitudinal brain MRI scans (1-year follow-up) of 104 AD patients
	(age: 75.7+/-7.2 years; MMSE: 23.3+/-1.8, at baseline), 254 amnestic
	MCI subjects (75.0+/-7.2 years; 27.0+/-1.8), and 157 healthy elderly
	subjects (75.9+/-5.1 years; 29.1+/-1.0), as part of the Alzheimer's
	Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To determine which TBM designs
	gave greatest statistical power, we compared different linear and
	nonlinear registration parameters (including different regularization
	functions), and different numerical summary measures derived from
	the maps. Detection power was greatly enhanced by summarizing changes
	in a statistically-defined region-of-interest (ROI) derived from
	an independent training sample of 22 AD patients. Effect sizes were
	compared using cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots and false
	discovery rate methods. In power analyses, the best method required
	only 48 AD and 88 MCI subjects to give 80\% power to detect a 25\%
	reduction in the mean annual change using a two-sided test (at alpha=0.05).
	This is a drastic sample size reduction relative to using clinical
	scores as outcome measures (619 AD/6797 MCI for the ADAS-Cog, and
	408 AD/796 MCI for the Clinical Dementia Rating sum-of-boxes scores).

	studies using a customized program. METHODS: We designed a protocol
	in which the volumes of the entorhinal, perirhinal, and temporopolar
	cortices were determined from coronal MR images using anatomic landmarks
	defined on the basis of cytoarchitectonic analyses of 49 autopsy
	cases. MR volumetry of these cortical areas was performed in 52 healthy
	volunteers. RESULTS: The overall mean volumes were 1768 +/- 328 mm3/1558
	+/- 341 mm3 (right/left) for the entorhinal cortex, 2512 +/- 672
	mm3/2572 +/- 666 mm3 for the perirhinal cortex, and 2960 +/- 623
	mm3/3091 +/- 636 mm3 for the temporopolar cortex. The right entorhinal
	cortex was 12\% larger than the left. The volume of the temporopolar
	cortex was reduced bilaterally by 13\% in the older age group compared
	with younger subjects, while the volumes of the entorhinal and perirhinal
	cortices were unaffected by age. There were no differences between

	Our method provides a tool by which to measure volumes of the entorhinal,
	perirhinal, and temporopolar cortices on coronal MR images.},

	Abstract = {The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal
	multisite observational study of healthy elders, mild cognitive impairment
	(MCI), and Alzheimer's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
	(18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET),
	urine serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, as well as
	clinical/psychometric assessments are acquired at multiple time points.
	All data will be cross-linked and made available to the general scientific
	community. The purpose of this report is to describe the MRI methods
	employed in ADNI. The ADNI MRI core established specifications that
	guided protocol development. A major effort was devoted to evaluating
	3D T(1)-weighted sequences for morphometric analyses. Several options
	for this sequence were optimized for the relevant manufacturer platforms
	and then compared in a reduced-scale clinical trial. The protocol
	selected for the ADNI study includes: back-to-back 3D magnetization
	prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans; B(1)-calibration scans
	when applicable; and an axial proton density-T(2) dual contrast (i.e.,
	echo) fast spin echo/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) for pathology detection.
	ADNI MRI methods seek to maximize scientific utility while minimizing
	the burden placed on participants. The approach taken in ADNI to
	standardization across sites and platforms of the MRI protocol, postacquisition
	corrections, and phantom-based monitoring of all scanners could be
	used as a model for other multisite trials.},

	Abstract = {To date, most diagnostic imaging comparisons between amyloid labelling
	ligands and other imaging modalities have been between the use of
	amyloid labelling ligand (11)C Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and FDG-PET.
	Our objectives were to compare cognitive performance and diagnostic
	group-wise discrimination between cognitively normal, amnestic mild
	cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease subjects with
	MRI-based measures of hippocampal volume and PiB retention, and secondly
	to evaluate the topographic distribution of PiB retention and grey
	matter loss using 3D voxel-wise methods. Twenty cognitively normal,
	17 amnestic MCI and 8 probable Alzheimer's disease subjects were
	imaged with both MRI and PiB. PiB retention was quantified as the
	ratio of uptake in cortical to cerebellar regions of interest (ROIs)
	40-60 min post-injection. A global cortical PiB retention summary
	measure was derived from six cortical ROIs. Statistical parametric
	mapping (SPM) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were used to evaluate
	PiB retention and grey matter loss on a 3D voxel-wise basis. Alzheimer's
	disease subjects had high global cortical PiB retention and low hippocampal
	volume; most cognitively normal subjects had low PiB retention and
	high hippocampal volume; and on average amnestic MCI subjects were
	intermediate on both PiB and hippocampal volume. A target-to-cerebellar
	ratio of 1.5 was used to designate subjects with high or low PiB
	cortical retention. All Alzheimer's disease subjects fell above this
	ratio, as did 6 out of 20 cognitively normal subjects and 9 out of
	17 MCI subjects, indicating bi-modal PiB retention in the latter
	two groups. Interestingly, we found no consistent differences in
	learning and memory performance between high versus low PiB cognitively
	normal or amnestic MCI subjects. The SPM/VBM voxel-wise comparisons
	of Alzheimer's disease versus cognitively normal subjects provided
	complementary information in that clear and meaningful similarities
	and differences in topographical distribution of amyloid deposition
	and grey matter loss were shown. The frontal lobes had high PiB retention
	with little grey matter loss, anteromedial temporal areas had low
	PiB retention with significant grey matter loss, whereas lateral
	temporoparietal association cortex displayed both significant PiB
	retention and grey matter loss. A voxel-wise SPM conjunction analysis
	revealed that subjects with high PiB retention shared a common PiB
	retention topographical pattern regardless of clinical category,
	and this matched that of amyloid plaque distribution from autopsy
	studies of Alzheimer's disease. Both global cortical PiB retention
	and hippocampal volumes demonstrated significant correlation in the
	expected direction with cognitive testing performance; however, correlations
	were stronger with MRI than PiB. Pair-wise inter-group diagnostic
	separation was significant for all group-wise pairs for both PiB
	and hippocampal volume with the exception of the comparison of cognitively
	normal versus amnestic MCI, which was not significant for PiB. PiB
	and MRI provided complementary information such that clinical diagnostic
	classification using both methods was superior to using either in
	isolation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cognitive continuum in the elderly population can
	be conceptually divided into those who are functioning normally (control
	subjects), those with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and those
	with probable AD. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that the annualized
	rates of hippocampal atrophy differ as a function of both baseline
	and change in clinical group membership (control, MCI, or AD). METHODS:
	The authors identified 129 subjects from the Mayo Clinic AD Research
	Center/AD Patient Registry who met established criteria for normal
	control subjects, MCI, or probable AD, both at entry and at the time
	of a subsequent clinical follow-up evaluation 3 +/- 1 years later.
	Each subject underwent an MRI examination of the head at the time
	of the initial assessment and at follow-up clinical assessment; the
	annualized percentage change in hippocampal volume was computed.
	Subjects who were classified as controls or patients with MCI at
	baseline could either remain cognitively stable or could decline
	to a lower functioning group over the period of observation. RESULTS:
	The annualized rates of hippocampal volume loss for each of the three
	initial clinical groups decreased progressively in the following
	order: AD > MC > control. Within the control and MCI groups, those
	who declined had a significantly greater rate of volume loss than
	those who remained clinically stable. The mean annualized rates of
	hippocampal atrophy by follow-up clinical group were: control-stable
	1.73\%, control-decliner 2.81\%, MCI-stable 2.55\%, MCI-decliner

	subjects compared with healthy young adults, and greater atrophy
	in patients with AD relative to elderly control subjects. However,
	rates of atrophy are estimated most accurately by performing serial
	measurements in the same individuals. METHODS: MRI-based volumetric

	matched with respect to gender and age with 24 patients with AD.
	Each subject underwent an MRI protocol twice, separated by 12 months

	A statistically significant yearly decline in hippocampal volume

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the atrophy rate measured from
	serial MRI studies is associated with time to subsequent clinical
	conversion to a more impaired state in both cognitively healthy elderly
	subjects and in subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment
	(MCI). METHODS: Ninety-one healthy elderly patients and 72 patients
	with amnestic MCI who met inclusion criteria were identified from
	the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Alzheimer's Disease
	Patient Registry. Atrophy rates of four different brain structures--hippocampus,
	entorhinal cortex, whole brain, and ventricle--were measured from
	a pair of MRI studies separated by 1 to 2 years. The time of the
	second scan marked the beginning of the clinical observation period.
	RESULTS: During follow-up, 13 healthy patients converted to MCI or
	Alzheimer disease (AD), whereas 39 MCI subjects converted to AD.
	Among those healthy at baseline, only larger ventricular annual percent
	volume change (APC) was associated with a higher risk of conversion
	(hazard ratio for a 1-SD increase 1.9, p = 0.03). Among MCI subjects,
	both greater ventricular volume APC (hazard ratio for a 1-SD increase
	1.7, p < 0.001) and greater whole brain APC (hazard ratio for a 1-SD
	increase 1.4, p = 0.007) increased the risk of conversion to AD.
	Both ventricular APC (hazard ratio for a 1-SD increase 1.59, p =
	0.001) and whole brain APC (hazard ratio for a 1-SD increase 1.32,
	p = 0.009) provided additional predictive information to covariate-adjusted
	cross-sectional hippocampal volume at baseline about the risk of
	converting from MCI to AD. DISCUSSION: Higher whole brain and ventricle
	atrophy rates 1 to 2 years before baseline are associated with an
	increased hazard of conversion to a more impaired state. Combining
	a measure of hippocampal volume at baseline with a measure of either
	whole brain or ventricle atrophy rates from serial MRI scans provides
	complimentary predictive information about the hazard of subsequent
	conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease. However,
	overlap among those who did vs those who did not convert indicate
	that these measures are unlikely to provide absolute prognostic information

	Abstract = {We present a method for coregistration and warping of magnetic resonance

	methodology consists of a modified head and hat surface-based registration
	algorithm followed by a new automated warping approach using nonlinear
	thin plate splines to compensate for distortions between the data
	sets. To test the methodology, 15 male Wistar rats were subjected
	to focal cerebral ischemia via permanent occlusion of the middle
	cerebral artery. The MRI images were acquired in separate groups
	of animals at 16-24 h (n = 9) and 48-168 h (n = 6) postocclusion.
	After imaging, animals were immediately sacrificed and hematoxylin-
	and eosin-stained brain sections were obtained for histological analysis.
	The MRI was coregistered and warped to histological sections. The
	MRI lesion areas were defined using the Eigenimage (EI) filter technique.
	The EI is a linear filter that maximizes the projection of a desired
	tissue (ischemic tissue) while it minimizes the projection of undesired
	tissues (nonischemic tissue) onto a composite image called an EI.
	When using coregistration without warping the MRI lesion area demonstrated
	poor correlation (r = 0.55, p > 0.01) with a percent difference between
	the two lesion areas of 22.5\% +/- 10.8\%. After warping, the MRI
	and histology had significant correlation (r = 0.97, p < 0.01) and
	a decreased percent difference of 5.56\% +/- 4.31\%. This methodology
	is simple and robust for coregistration and warping of MRI to histological

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to test the hypothesis that baseline
	glucose metabolism and medial temporal lobe brain volumes are predictive
	of cognitive decline in normal older people. METHODS: We performed
	positron emission tomography using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and structural
	magnetic resonance imaging at baseline in 60 cognitively normal community-dwelling
	older subjects who were part of a longitudinal cohort study. Subjects
	were followed for a mean of 3.8 years, with approximately annual
	evaluation of global cognition (the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination)
	and episodic memory (delayed recall). Baseline brain volumes and
	glucose metabolism were evaluated in relation to the rate of change
	in cognitive test scores. RESULTS: Six subjects developed incident
	dementia or cognitive impairment (converters). Baseline positron
	emission tomography scans showed regions in left and right angular
	gyrus, left mid-temporal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus that
	predicted the rate of change on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination
	(p < 0.001). The left hemisphere temporal and parietal regions remained
	significant when converters were excluded. Both hippocampal (p =
	0.03) and entorhinal cortical volumes (p = 0.01) predicted decline
	on delayed recall over time, and entorhinal cortical volumes remained
	significant when converters were excluded (p = 0.02). These brain
	volumes did not predict Modified Mini-Mental State Examination decline.
	INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that temporal and parietal
	glucose metabolism predict decline in global cognitive function,
	and medial temporal brain volumes predict memory decline in normal
	older people. The anatomical location of these findings suggests
	detection of preclinical Alzheimer's disease pathology.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The assessment of mesial temporal lobe (MTL) function
	is important for the diagnosis and treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy
	(TLE) and other brain diseases. Declarative memory depends on the
	integrity of the MTL region. OBJECTIVE: To investigate hemispheric
	asymmetries of MTL activity in patients with symptomatic TLE. METHODS:
	With use of blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI, hemispheric asymmetries
	in MTL activation of 30 individual patients with refractory symptomatic
	TLE and 17 healthy control subjects were studied. Activation was
	induced by a task employing mental navigation and recall of landmarks
	based on the retrieval of individually familiar visuospatial knowledge.
	RESULTS: The study demonstrated that the memory task used reliably
	activated MTL structures in individual control subjects and patients
	with refractory TLE including children, older subjects, and patients
	with low formal IQ. Interhemispheric differences in MTL activation
	lateralized the side of seizure onset in 90\% of patients with symptomatic
	unilateral TLE. In contrast, healthy control subjects did not show
	a systematic asymmetry of MTL activation. Correlations between MTL
	activation and neuropsychological measures suggest that the fMRI-detectable
	MTL changes were specifically related to memory rather than to memory-independent
	visuospatial abilities. CONCLUSION: fMRI of memory-induced MTL activation
	lateralizes the side of seizure onset in patients with refractory
	symptomatic TLE and may provide complementary information for presurgical
	evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) is unique in
	providing information about both the structural integrity and the
	orientation of white matter fibers in vivo and, through "tractography",
	revealing the trajectories of white matter tracts. DT-MRI is therefore
	a promising technique for detecting differences in white matter architecture
	between different subject populations. However, while studies involving
	analyses of group averages of scalar quantities derived from DT-MRI
	data have been performed, as yet there have been no similar studies
	involving the whole tensor. Here we present the first step towards
	realizing such a study, i.e., the spatial normalization of whole
	tensor data sets. The approach is illustrated by spatial normalization
	of 10 DT-MRI data sets to a standard anatomical template. Both qualitative
	and quantitative approaches are described for assessing the results
	of spatial normalization. Techniques are then described for combining
	the spatially normalized data sets according to three definitions
	of average, i.e., the mean, median, and mode of a distribution of
	tensors. The current absence of, and hence need for, appropriate
	statistical tests for comparison of results derived from group-averaged
	DT-MRI data sets is then discussed. Finally, the feasibility of performing
	tractography on the group-averaged DT-MRI data set is investigated

	Abstract = {Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been used to analyze diffusion tensor
	MRI (DT-MRI) data in a number of studies. In VBM, following spatial
	normalization, data are smoothed to improve the validity of statistical
	inferences and to reduce inter-individual variation. However, the
	size of the smoothing filter used for VBM of DT-MRI data is highly
	variable across studies. For example, a literature review revealed
	that Gaussian smoothing kernels ranging in size (full width at half
	maximum) from zero to 16 mm have been used in DT-MRI VBM type studies.
	To investigate the effect of varying filter size in such analyses,
	whole brain DT-MRI data from 14 schizophrenic patients were compared
	with those of 14 matched control subjects using VBM, when the filter
	size was varied from zero to 16 mm. Within this range of smoothing,
	four different conclusions regarding apparent patient control differences
	could be made: (i) no significant patient-control differences; (ii)
	reduced FA in right superior temporal gyrus (STG) in patients; (iii)
	reduced FA in both right STG and left cerebellum in patients; and
	(iv) reduced FA only in left cerebellum in patients. These findings
	stress the importance of recognizing the effect of the matched filter
	theorem on VBM analyses of DT-MRI data. Finally, we investigated
	whether one of the underlying assumptions of parametric VBM, i.e.,
	the normality of the residuals, is met. Our results suggest that,

	white matter regions may have non-normally distributed residuals

	Abstract = {The brain activation of a group of high-functioning autistic participants
	was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging during the
	performance of a Tower of London task, in comparison with a control
	group matched with respect to intelligent quotient, age, and gender.
	The 2 groups generally activated the same cortical areas to similar
	degrees. However, there were 3 indications of underconnectivity in
	the group with autism. First, the degree of synchronization (i.e.,
	the functional connectivity or the correlation of the time series
	of the activation) between the frontal and parietal areas of activation
	was lower for the autistic than the control participants. Second,
	relevant parts of the corpus callosum, through which many of the
	bilaterally activated cortical areas communicate, were smaller in
	cross-sectional area in the autistic participants. Third, within
	the autism group but not within the control group, the size of the
	genu of the corpus callosum was correlated with frontal-parietal
	functional connectivity. These findings suggest that the neural basis
	of altered cognition in autism entails a lower degree of integration
	of information across certain cortical areas resulting from reduced
	intracortical connectivity. The results add support to a new theory
	of cortical underconnectivity in autism, which posits a deficit in
	integration of information at the neural and cognitive levels.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Velocardiofacial syndrome, caused by a microdeletion on
	chromosome 22q.11, is associated with craniofacial anomalies, cardiac
	defects, learning disabilities, and psychiatric disorders. To understand
	how the 22q.11 deletion affects brain development, this study examined
	gray and white matter volumes in major lobar brain regions of children
	with velocardiofacial syndrome relative to control subjects. METHODS:
	Subjects were ten children with velocardiofacial syndrome and ten
	age- and gender-matched unaffected children. Coronal images were
	acquired with a 3-D spoiled gradient echo series and partitioned
	into 124, 1.5-mm contiguous slices. A stereotaxic grid was used to
	subdivide brain tissue into cerebral lobes, which were segmented
	into gray, white, and CSF compartments using an algorithm based on
	intensity values and tissue boundaries. Nonparametric statistics
	were used to compare lobar volumes of gray and white matter. RESULTS:
	Analyses indicated that children with velocardiofacial syndrome had
	significantly smaller volumes in nonfrontal, but not frontal, lobar
	brain regions. Volume reductions affected nonfrontal white matter
	to a greater extent than nonfrontal gray matter. CONCLUSIONS: The
	presence of white matter reductions may be related to disturbances
	in myelination or axonal integrity in velocardiofacial syndrome.
	Further work is required to delineate the nature and extent of white
	matter anomalies, and to link them to variation in the neurocognitive
	and neuropsychiatric phenotype of velocardiofacial syndrome.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new technique for the automatic model-based
	segmentation of three-dimensional (3-D) objects from volumetric image
	data. The development closely follows the seminal work of Taylor
	and Cootes on active shape models, but is based on a hierarchical
	parametric object description rather than a point distribution model.
	The segmentation system includes both the building of statistical
	models and the automatic segmentation of new image data sets via
	a restricted elastic deformation of shape models. Geometric models
	are derived from a sample set of image data which have been segmented
	by experts. The surfaces of these binary objects are converted into
	parametric surface representations, which are normalized to get an
	invariant object-centered coordinate system. Surface representations
	are expanded into series of spherical harmonics which provide parametric
	descriptions of object shapes. It is shown that invariant object
	surface parametrization provides a good approximation to automatically
	determine object homology in terms of sets of corresponding sets
	of surface points. Gray-level information near object boundaries
	is represented by 1-D intensity profiles normal to the surface. Considering
	automatic segmentation of brain structures as our driving application,
	our choice of coordinates for object alignment was the well-accepted
	stereotactic coordinate system. Major variation of object shapes
	around the mean shape, also referred to as shape eigenmodes, are
	calculated in shape parameter space rather than the feature space
	of point coordinates. Segmentation makes use of the object shape
	statistics by restricting possible elastic deformations into the
	range of the training shapes. The mean shapes are initialized in
	a new data set by specifying the landmarks of the stereotactic coordinate
	system. The model elastically deforms, driven by the displacement
	forces across the object's surface, which are generated by matching
	local intensity profiles. Elastic deformations are limited by setting
	bounds for the maximum variations in eigenmode space. The technique
	has been applied to automatically segment left and right hippocampus,
	thalamus, putamen, and globus pallidus from volumetric magnetic resonance
	scans taken from schizophrenia studies. The results have been validated
	by comparison of automatic segmentation with the results obtained
	by interactive expert segmentation.},

	Abstract = {The assessment of significant activations in functional imaging using
	voxel-based methods often relies on results derived from the theory
	of Gaussian random fields. These results solve the multiple comparison
	problem and assume that the spatial correlation or smoothness of
	the data is known or can be estimated. End results (i. e., P values
	associated with local maxima, clusters, or sets of clusters) critically
	depend on this assessment, which should be as exact and as reliable
	as possible. In some earlier implementations of statistical parametric
	mapping (SPM) (SPM94, SPM95) the smoothness was assessed on Gaussianized
	t-fields (Gt-f) that are not generally free of physiological signal.
	This technique has two limitations. First, the estimation is not
	stable (the variance of the estimator being far from negligible)
	and, second, physiological signal in the Gt-f will bias the estimation.
	In this paper, we describe an estimation method that overcomes these
	drawbacks. The new approach involves estimating the smoothness of
	standardized residual fields which approximates the smoothness of
	the component fields of the associated t-field. Knowing the smoothness
	of these component fields is important because it allows one to compute
	corrected P values for statistical fields other than the t-field
	or the Gt-f (e.g., the F-map) and eschews bias due to deviation from
	the null hypothesis. We validate the method on simulated data and
	demonstrate it using data from a functional MRI study.},

	in neuroscientific applications of diffusion tensor imaging, and
	the most popular method for building them is fiber tractography.
	For some analysis tasks, however, a compelling alternative may be
	found in the first and second derivatives of diffusion anisotropy.
	We extend to tensor fields the notion from classical computer vision
	of ridges and valleys, and define anisotropy creases as features
	of locally extremal tensor anisotropy. Mathematically, these are
	the loci where the gradient of anisotropy is orthogonal to one or
	more eigenvectors of its Hessian. We propose that anisotropy creases
	provide a basis for extracting a skeleton of the major white matter
	pathways, in that ridges of anisotropy coincide with interiors of
	fiber tracts, and valleys of anisotropy coincide with the interfaces
	between adjacent but distinctly oriented tracts. The crease extraction
	algorithm we present generates high-quality polygonal models of crease

	Abstract = {The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is critical for declarative memory
	formation. Several theories of MTL function propose functional distinctions
	between the different structures of the MTL, namely the hippocampus
	and the surrounding cortical areas. Furthermore, computational models
	and electrophysiological studies in animals suggest distinctions
	between the subregions of the hippocampus itself. Standard fMRI resolution
	is not sufficiently fine to resolve activity on the scale of hippocampal
	subregions. Several approaches to scanning the MTL at high resolutions
	have been made, however there are limitations to these approaches,
	namely difficulty in conducting group-level analyses. We demonstrate
	here techniques for scanning the MTL at high resolution and analyzing
	the high-resolution fMRI data at the group level. To address the
	issue of cross-participant alignment, we employ the ROI-LDDMM alignment
	technique, which is demonstrated to result in smaller alignment errors
	when compared with several other common normalization techniques.
	Finally, we demonstrate that the pattern of activation obtained in
	the high-resolution functional data is similar to that obtained at
	lower resolution, although the spatial extent is smaller and the
	percent signal change is greater. This difference in the pattern
	of activation may be due to less partial volume sampling in the high-resolution
	data, resulting in more accentuated regions of activation.},

	of clinical "red flags." DESIGN: Autopsy examination of both prospective
	and retrospective subjects consecutively enrolled in this clinicopathologic
	study of the RADP. SETTING: University hospital and research center,
	using a multidisciplinary geriatric neurology clinic, satellite clinics,
	nursing home visits, and home visits. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy
	subjects clinically diagnosed as having AD who were enrolled in the
	RADP between 1983 and 1993 underwent neuropathologic examination.
	Of these, 93 had been enrolled prospectively and 77 retrospectively.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement between clinical and pathologic
	diagnoses. RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine subjects of 170 clinically
	diagnosed as having AD fulfilled the pathologic criteria for AD,
	yielding an accuracy rate of 88\%. Of 93 subjects enrolled prospectively
	and diagnosed as having AD, 83 (90\%) met the histologic criteria
	for AD. Of the 77 subjects enrolled retrospectively, neuropathologic
	examination indicated definite AD in 66 (86\%). CONCLUSIONS: There
	was a high correlation between clinicians' diagnoses and final pathologic
	diagnoses. The most common clinical errors involved the misdiagnosis
	of dementias due to Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease.
	There was no significant difference in the accuracy rates of subjects
	enrolled prospectively and retrospectively.},

	Abstract = {All fields of neuroscience that employ brain imaging need to communicate
	their results with reference to anatomical regions. In particular,
	comparative morphometry and group analysis of functional and physiological
	data require coregistration of brains to establish correspondences
	across brain structures. It is well established that linear registration
	of one brain to another is inadequate for aligning brain structures,
	so numerous algorithms have emerged to nonlinearly register brains
	to one another. This study is the largest evaluation of nonlinear
	deformation algorithms applied to brain image registration ever conducted.
	Fourteen algorithms from laboratories around the world are evaluated
	using 8 different error measures. More than 45,000 registrations
	between 80 manually labeled brains were performed by algorithms including:
	AIR, ANIMAL, ART, Diffeomorphic Demons, FNIRT, IRTK, JRD-fluid, ROMEO,
	SICLE, SyN, and four different SPM5 algorithms ("SPM2-type" and regular
	Normalization, Unified Segmentation, and the DARTEL Toolbox). All
	of these registrations were preceded by linear registration between
	the same image pairs using FLIRT. One of the most significant findings
	of this study is that the relative performances of the registration
	methods under comparison appear to be little affected by the choice
	of subject population, labeling protocol, and type of overlap measure.
	This is important because it suggests that the findings are generalizable
	to new subject populations that are labeled or evaluated using different
	labeling protocols. Furthermore, we ranked the 14 methods according
	to three completely independent analyses (permutation tests, one-way
	ANOVA tests, and indifference-zone ranking) and derived three almost
	identical top rankings of the methods. ART, SyN, IRTK, and SPM's
	DARTEL Toolbox gave the best results according to overlap and distance
	measures, with ART and SyN delivering the most consistently high
	accuracy across subjects and label sets. Updates will be published
	on the http://www.mindboggle.info/papers/ website.},

	Abstract = {Mindboggle (http://www.binarybottle.com/mindboggle.html) is a fully
	automated, feature matching approach to label cortical structures
	and activity anatomically in human brain MRI data. This approach
	does not assume that the existence of component structures and their
	relative spatial relationship is preserved from brain to brain, but
	instead disassembles a labeled atlas and reassembles its pieces to
	match corresponding pieces in an unlabeled subject brain before labeling.
	Mindboggle: (1) converts linearly coregistered subject and atlas
	MRI data into sulcus pieces, (2) matches each atlas piece with a
	combination of subject pieces by minimizing a cost function, (3)
	transforms atlas label boundaries to the matching subject pieces,
	(4) warps atlas labels to their transformed boundaries, and (5) propagates
	labels to fill remaining gaps in a mask derived from the subject
	brain. We compared Mindboggle with four registration methods: linear
	registration, and nonlinear registration using SPM2, AIR, and ANIMAL.
	Automated labeling by all of the nonlinear methods was found to be
	at least comparable with linear registration. Mindboggle outperformed
	every other method, as measured by the agreement between overlapping
	atlas labels and manually assigned subject labels, with respect to
	the union or the intersection of voxels. After applying the same
	procedure that Mindboggle uses to fill a subject's segmented gray
	matter mask with labels (step 5), the results of the other methods
	improved. However, after performing a one-way ANOVA (and Tukey's
	honestly significant difference criterion) in a multiple comparison
	between the results obtained by the different methods, Mindboggle
	was still found to be the only nonlinear method whose labeling performance
	was significantly better than that of linear registration or SPM2.
	Further advantages to Mindboggle include a high degree of robustness
	against image artifacts, poor image quality, and incomplete brain
	data. We tested the latter hypothesis by conducting all of the tests
	again, this time registering the atlas to an artificially lesioned
	version of itself, and found that Mindboggle was the only method
	whose performance did not degrade significantly as the lesion size
	increased.},

	Abstract = {Memory testing during the intracarotid amobarbital procedure (IAP)

	"at risk" for developing severe postoperative anterograde amnesia.
	However, the utility of the IAP in predicting commonly observed material-specific

	the utility of contralateral IAP memory testing, as an index of the
	functional capacity of the surgical temporal lobe, to predict postoperative
	material-specific memory changes on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised
	(WMS-R) in patients with left hemisphere speech dominance undergoing

	patients who "passed" contralateral IAP memory testing (> or = 68\%

	decrements than those who "failed" the IAP, presumably as a result
	of removal of functional tissue. A similar relationship between contralateral
	IAP performance and visual memory performance was not observed among
	right TL patients. Thus, the functional adequacy of the tissue to
	be resected appears to be inversely related to postoperative verbal
	memory decrement, at least among left TL patients. This relationship

@article{knopman01,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To update the 1994 practice parameter for the diagnosis
	of dementia in the elderly. BACKGROUND: The AAN previously published
	a practice parameter on dementia in 1994. New research and clinical
	developments warrant an update of some aspects of diagnosis. METHODS:
	Studies published in English from 1985 through 1999 were identified
	that addressed four questions: 1) Are the current criteria for the
	diagnosis of dementia reliable? 2) Are the current diagnostic criteria
	able to establish a diagnosis for the prevalent dementias in the
	elderly? 3) Do laboratory tests improve the accuracy of the clinical
	diagnosis of dementing illness? 4) What comorbidities should be evaluated
	in elderly patients undergoing an initial assessment for dementia?
	RECOMMENDATIONS: Based on evidence in the literature, the following
	recommendations are made. 1) The DSM-III-R definition of dementia
	is reliable and should be used (Guideline). 2) The National Institute
	of Neurologic, Communicative Disorders and Stroke--AD and Related
	Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) or the Diagnostic and Statistical
	Manual, 3rd edition, revised (DSM-IIIR) diagnostic criteria for AD
	and clinical criteria for Creutzfeldt--Jakob disease (CJD) have sufficient
	reliability and validity and should be used (Guideline). Diagnostic
	criteria for vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal
	dementia may be of use in clinical practice (Option) but have imperfect
	reliability and validity. 3) Structural neuroimaging with either
	a noncontrast CT or MR scan in the initial evaluation of patients
	with dementia is appropriate. Because of insufficient data on validity,
	no other imaging procedure is recommended (Guideline). There are
	currently no genetic markers recommended for routine diagnostic purposes
	(Guideline). The CSF 14-3-3 protein is useful for confirming or rejecting
	the diagnosis of CJD (Guideline). 4) Screening for depression, B(12)
	deficiency, and hypothyroidism should be performed (Guideline). Screening
	for syphilis in patients with dementia is not justified unless clinical
	suspicion for neurosyphilis is present (Guideline). CONCLUSIONS:
	Diagnostic criteria for dementia have improved since the 1994 practice
	parameter. Further research is needed to improve clinical definitions
	of dementia and its subtypes, as well as to determine the utility
	of various instruments of neuroimaging, biomarkers, and genetic testing
	in increasing diagnostic accuracy.},

	the jets are partial derivatives whose corresponding RF profiles
	closely mimic the well known units in the primary visual cortex.
	Hence this description provides a novel means to understand and classify
	these units. Taking the receptive field outputs as the basic input

@article{kotcheff98,
	Abstract = {A new approach to the problem of automatic construction of eigenshape
	models is presented. Eigenshape models have proved to be successful
	in a variety of medical image analysis problems. However, automatic
	construction of eigenshape models has proved to be a difficult problem,
	and in many applications the models are built by hand-a painstaking
	process. We show that the fundamental problem is a choice of the
	correct pose and parametrization of each shape in the training set.
	Eigenshape models are not invariant under reparametrizations and
	pose transformations of the training shapes. Since there is no a
	priori correct choice for the pose and parametrization of each shape,
	their value should be chosen so as to produce a model that is compact
	and specific. This problem can be solved by finding an objective
	function that measures these properties and varying the pose and
	parametrization of each shape to optimize this function. We show
	that the appropriate objective function is the determinant of the
	covariance matrix. We go on to show how this objective function can
	be optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) and thus give a practical
	method for building eigenshape models. The models produced are often
	better than hand-built ones. The advantages of a GA over other choices
	of optimization method are that no assumptions about the nature of
	the shapes being modelled is required and that the global minimum
	of the objective function can, in principle, be found.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is one of the few areas of the rodent brain that continues
	to produce neurons postnatally. Neurogenesis reportedly persists
	in rats up to 11 months of age. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling,
	the present study confirms that in the adult rat brain, neuronal
	progenitor cells divide at the border between the hilus and the granule
	cell layer (GCL). In adult rats, the progeny of these cells migrate
	into the GCL and express the neuronal markers NeuN and calbindin-D28k.
	However, neurogenesis was drastically reduced in aged rats. Six-to
	27-month-old Fischer rats were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU
	to detect newborn cells in vivo and to follow their fate in the dentate
	gyrus. When killed 4-6 weeks after BrdU labeling, 12- to 27-month-old
	rats exhibited a significant decline in the density of BrdU-positive
	cells in the granule cell layer compared with 6-month-old controls.
	Decreased neurogenesis in aging rats was accompanied by reduced immunoreactivity

	structures from diffusion tensor images (DTI). A DTI produces, from
	a set of diffusion-weighted MR images, tensor-valued images where
	each voxel is assigned with a 3 x 3 symmetric, positive-definite
	matrix. This second order tensor is simply the covariance matrix
	of a local Gaussian process, with zero-mean, modeling the average
	motion of water molecules. As we will show in this paper, the definition
	of a dissimilarity measure and statistics between such quantities
	is a nontrivial task which must be tackled carefully. We claim and
	demonstrate that, by using the theoretically well-founded differential
	geometrical properties of the manifold of multivariate normal distributions,
	it is possible to improve the quality of the segmentation results
	obtained with other dissimilarity measures such as the Euclidean
	distance or the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The main goal of this
	paper is to prove that the choice of the probability metric, i.e.,
	the dissimilarity measure, has a deep impact on the tensor statistics
	and, hence, on the achieved results. We introduce a variational formulation,
	in the level-set framework, to estimate the optimal segmentation
	of a DTI according to the following hypothesis: Diffusion tensors
	exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the different partitions. We must
	also respect the geometric constraints imposed by the interfaces
	existing among the cerebral structures and detected by the gradient
	of the DTI. We show how to express all the statistical quantities

	demonstrated cognitive decline (11 to MCI and 1 to Alzheimer's disease).
	Nondeclining controls were matched on apolipoprotein E genotype,

	unbiased nonlinear image registration. First, we argue that logarithmic
	transformation is crucial for analyzing Jacobian values representing
	morphometric differences. We then examine the statistical distributions
	of log-Jacobian maps by defining the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance
	on material density functions arising in continuum-mechanical models.
	With this framework, unbiased image registration can be constructed
	by quantifying the symmetric KL-distance between the identity map
	and the resulting deformation. Implementation details, addressing
	the proposed unbiased registration as well as the minimization of
	symmetric image matching functionals, are then discussed and shown
	to be applicable to other registration methods, such as inverse consistent
	registration. In the results section, we test the proposed framework,
	as well as present an illustrative application mapping detailed 3-D
	brain changes in sequential magnetic resonance imaging scans of a
	patient diagnosed with semantic dementia. Using permutation tests,
	we show that the symmetrization of image registration statistically
	reduces skewness in the log-Jacobian map.},

	Abstract = {Tensor-based morphometry can recover three-dimensional longitudinal
	brain changes over time by nonlinearly registering baseline to follow-up
	MRI scans of the same subject. Here, we compared the anatomical distribution
	of longitudinal brain structural changes, over 12 months, using a
	subset of the ADNI dataset consisting of 20 patients with Alzheimer's
	disease (AD), 40 healthy elderly controls, and 40 individuals with
	mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Each individual longitudinal change
	map (Jacobian map) was created using an unbiased registration technique,
	and spatially normalized to a geometrically-centered average image
	based on healthy controls. Voxelwise statistical analyses revealed
	regional differences in atrophy rates, and these differences were
	correlated with clinical measures and biomarkers. Consistent with
	prior studies, we detected widespread cerebral atrophy in AD, and
	a more restricted atrophic pattern in MCI. In MCI, temporal lobe
	atrophy rates were correlated with changes in mini-mental state exam
	(MMSE) scores, clinical dementia rating (CDR), and logical/verbal
	learning memory scores. In AD, temporal atrophy rates were correlated
	with several biomarker indices, including a higher CSF level of p-tau
	protein, and a greater CSF tau/beta amyloid 1-42 (ABeta42) ratio.
	Temporal lobe atrophy was significantly faster in MCI subjects who
	converted to AD than in non-converters. Serial MRI scans can therefore
	be analyzed with nonlinear image registration to relate ongoing neurodegeneration

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: "Cognitive" circuits anatomically link the frontal lobe
	to subcortical structures; therefore, pathology in any of the core
	components of these circuits, such as in the caudate nucleus, may
	result in neurobehavioral syndromes similar to those of the frontal
	lobe. Neuroleptic medication, however, affects the size of the caudate
	nucleus. For this reason, individuals diagnosed with schizotypal
	personality disorder offer an ideal group for the measurement of
	the caudate nucleus because they may be genetically related to individuals
	with schizophrenia but do not require neuroleptic treatment because
	of their less severe symptoms. METHOD: Magnetic resonance imagining
	(MRI) scans obtained on a 1.5-T magnet with 1.5-mm contiguous slices
	were used to measure the caudate nucleus and lateral ventricles in
	15 right-handed male subjects with schizotypal personality disorder
	who had no previous neuroleptic exposure and in 14 normal comparison
	subjects. Subjects were group matched for parental socioeconomic
	status, handedness, and gender. RESULTS: First, the authors found
	significantly lower left and right absolute (13.1\%, 13.2\%) and
	relative (9.1\%, 9.2\%) caudate nucleus volumes in never-medicated
	subjects with schizotypal personality disorder than in normal subjects.
	Second, they found significant, inverse correlations between caudate
	nucleus volume and the severity of perseveration in two distinct
	working memory tasks in these neuroleptic-naive subjects with schizotypal
	personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with
	the findings of reduced caudate nucleus volume reported in studies
	of neuroleptic-naive patients experiencing their first episode of
	schizophrenia and support the association of intrinsic pathology
	in the caudate nucleus with abnormalities in working memory in the
	schizophrenia spectrum.},

	neuropsychological deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)
	and patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) would be valuable
	for diagnostic evaluation. METHODS: The Philadelphia Brief Assessment
	of Cognition (PBAC) assesses working memory/executive control, language,
	visuospatial operations, verbal/visual episodic memory, and behavior/social
	comportment and can be administered and scored in 15-20 min. Participants
	included 149 patients with AD and four groups of FTD patients - i.e.,
	patients with a decline in social comportment, personality, and executive
	functioning (SOC/EXEC), semantic dementia (SemD), progressive nonfluent
	aphasia (PNFA), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). RESULTS: The total
	PBAC score correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination. Between-group
	analysis of PBAC subscales and the results of logistic regression
	analyses produced substantial between-group differences, emphasizing
	the sensitivity of the test to differentiate dementia subtypes. AD
	patients were impaired on tests of episodic memory, SOC/EXEC patients
	were impaired on a measure of social comportment/behavioral disturbance,
	PNFA patients obtained low scores on tests of working memory/executive

	Abstract = {In this study, we introduced a length-normalized parameterization
	method to establish anatomical correspondence of white matter fiber
	tracts across subjects and applied this method to investigate the
	presence of abnormal diffusion along the pyramidal tract (PYT) of
	relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) patients without visible brain
	lesions. In this approach, the part of the PYT between the lowest
	slice of the cerebral peduncle and the uppermost slice of the lateral
	ventricle was reconstructed to establish the anatomical correspondence
	across subjects using diffusion tensor tractography. Then it was
	parameterized by normalizing its length and dividing equally the
	normalized length into a certain number of segments, so that the
	comparability of each segment across subjects along the PYT was established.
	Tract-specific diffusion indices, including directionally averaged
	diffusivity (D(av)), fractional anisotropy (FA), primary diffusivity
	(lambda(1)) and transverse diffusivity (lambda(23)), were obtained
	from each segment. Thus, the distribution maps of these indices along
	the PYT were obtained. The distribution maps of D(av), FA, and lambda(23)
	of RNMO patients were significantly different from those of healthy
	controls, especially in the lower part of the PYT. The differences
	may be caused by secondary degeneration to lesions in the spinal
	cord. In conclusion, a length-normalized parameterization method
	is proposed to establish anatomical correspondence for the PYT. Compared
	with existed methods, a major merit of our method is to provide comparability
	across subjects along the PYT on the basis of diffusion tensor tractography
	and to make it possible for the quantitative analysis along the fiber
	tract. This method can also be used to quantitatively analyze other
	white matter fiber tracts between two definite anatomic landmarks

	Abstract = {Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such
	as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is greatly
	aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify,

	of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features.
	First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries
	is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization
	constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior.
	Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity
	constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into
	place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of
	an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to
	identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries
	of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human MR images, accurately
	locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume
	artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted
	surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having
	the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological
	holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been
	applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the
	gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual.
	The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map
	of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness

	Abstract = {Grey matter volume in the posterior hippocampus of London taxi drivers
	is greater than in age-matched controls, and the size of this increase
	correlates positively with time spent taxi driving (E.A. Maguire
	et al., 2000. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 97: 4398-4403). This change
	suggests that increased posterior hippocampal grey matter volume
	is acquired in response to increased taxi driving experience, perhaps
	reflecting their detailed representation of the city. However, an
	alternate hypothesis is that the difference in hippocampal volume
	is instead associated with innate navigational expertise, leading
	to an increased likelihood of becoming a taxi driver. To investigate
	this possibility, we used structural brain imaging and voxel-based
	morphometry (VBM) to examine a group of subjects who were not taxi
	drivers. Despite this group showing a wide range of navigational
	expertise, there was no association between expertise and posterior
	hippocampal grey matter volume (or, indeed, grey matter volume throughout

	Abstract = {Several neuropsychiatric disorders involving hippocampal structural
	changes have been studied extensively using volumetric magnetic resonance
	imaging (MRI). These studies have mostly measured total hippocampal
	volume while the present study aimed to delineate and measure hippocampal
	subfields within the whole hippocampus and subdivisions along its
	longitudinal axis. Images were acquired at 4.7 T in 11 healthy subjects
	(5 males and 6 females, aged 23-56 years), using a fast spin echo
	(FSE) sequence with 0.52 x 0.68 x 1.0 mm(3) native resolution, collecting
	90 contiguous coronal slices. Subiculum, cornu ammonis (CA1-3), and
	dentate gyrus were traced manually within the hippocampal head, body,
	and tail. We reported volumes for the subfields and demonstrated
	differences in the distribution within the hippocampus and its parts.
	The biggest part of the dentate gyrus was located in the hippocampal
	body, following the hippocampal head and tail. In contrast, the hippocampal
	head had the largest part of CA1-3, following the hippocampal body
	and tail. The hippocampal tail had the smallest portion of the subiculum
	compared to hippocampal head and tail. Subfield volumes were consistent
	between hemispheres and showed distributions within the longitudinal
	subdivisions that were consistent with histological data. Direct
	measurements of subfield distribution along the longitudinal axis
	of the hippocampus may be more sensitive to detecting disease effects
	than total volume measures and the differential distribution of subfield
	volumes may aid in the interpretation of measurements obtained at
	lower field strength and spatial resolution.},

	(FDG) and postoperative seizure frequency after anterior temporal

	had anterior temporal lobectomy and preoperative assessment with
	PET-FDG. Qualitative PET analysis was performed visually by two blinded
	observers, and quantitative PET analysis was performed using an anatomic
	template for six control and six temporal lobe subregions, deriving
	an asymmetry index for each region. Seizure outcome was assessed
	1 year after surgery; patients were classified as being seizure-free
	or as having persistent seizures. Qualitative data were analyzed
	using Fisher's exact test and the t test, and quantitative data were
	analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA. Thirty-two patients (74\%)
	were seizure-free at follow-up, and 11 had persistent seizures, although
	most improved. Twenty-nine of 35 patients (83\%) with restricted
	temporal lobe hypometabolism by visual analysis were seizure-free,
	compared with three of eight patients (37.5\%) with normal scans
	or multilobar hypometabolism. Quantitative analysis revealed that
	an asymmetry of mesial temporal lobe glucose consumption (uncal region)
	correlated with improved surgical outcome (p < 0.02). We developed
	a logistic regression model to predict individual outcome based on
	the asymmetry in uncal metabolism. Lateral temporal metabolism did
	not correlate with outcome. We conclude that both visual PET analysis

	Hippocampal volume loss rates increased with worsening diagnosis

	while more educated controls atrophied more slowly; converters from
	MCI to AD showed faster atrophy than non-converters. Hippocampal
	loss rates can be rapidly mapped, and they track cognitive decline
	closely enough to be used as surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease
	in drug trials. They also reveal genetically greater atrophy in cognitively

	Research from lesion and functional neuroimaging studies on remote

	three theories of hippocampal and/or medial temporal lobe-neocortical
	interaction in memory retention and retrieval: cognitive map theory,
	standard consolidation theory and multiple trace theory. Each theory
	makes different predictions regarding first, the severity and extent

	retrieval of memory across time; and third, the type of memory being
	retrieved. Each of these theories has strengths and weaknesses, and
	there are various unresolved issues. We propose a unified account
	based on multiple trace theory. This theory states that the hippocampus
	is needed for re-experiencing detailed episodic and spatial memories
	no matter how old they are, and that it contributes to the formation
	and assimilation of semantic memories and schematic spatial maps.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 4 Tesla
	depicts details of the internal structure of the hippocampus not
	visible at 1.5 Tesla, and so allows for in vivo parcellation of different
	hippocampal subfields. The aim of this study was to test if distinct
	subfield atrophy patterns can be detected in temporal lobe epilepsy
	(TLE) with mesial temporal sclerosis (TLE-MTS) and without (TLE-no)
	hippocampal sclerosis. METHODS: High-resolution T(2)-weighted hippocampal
	images were acquired in 34 controls: 15 TLE-MTS and 18 TLE-no. Entorhinal
	cortex (ERC), subiculum (SUB), CA1, CA2, and CA3, and dentate (CA3&DG)
	volumes were determined using a manual parcellation scheme. RESULTS:
	TLE-MTS had significantly smaller ipsilateral CA1, CA2, CA3&DG, and
	total hippocampal volume than controls or TLE-no. Mean ipsilateral
	CA1 and CA3&DG z-scores were significantly lower than ipsilateral
	CA2, ERC, and SUB z-scores. There were no significant differences
	between the various subfield or hippocampal z-scores on either the
	ipsi- or the contralateral side in TLE-no. Using a z-score <or=-2.0
	to identify severe volume loss, the following atrophy patterns were
	found in TLE-MTS: CA1 atrophy, CA3&DG atrophy, CA1 and CA3&DG atrophy,
	and global hippocampal atrophy. Significant subfield atrophy was
	found in three TLE-no: contralateral SUB atrophy, bilateral CA3&DG
	atrophy, and ipsilateral ERC and SUB atrophy. DISCUSSION: Using a
	manual parcellation scheme on 4 Tesla high-resolution MRI, we found
	the characteristic ipsilateral CA1 and CA3&DG atrophy described in
	TLE-MTS. Seventeen percent of the TLE-no had subfield atrophy despite
	normal total hippocampal volume. These findings indicate that high-resolution
	MRI and subfield volumetry provide superior information compared
	to standard hippocampal volumetry.},

	Abstract = {The use of functional imaging to identify encoding-related areas in
	the medial temporal lobe has previously been explored for presurgical
	evaluation in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Optimizing sensitivity
	in such paradigms is critical for the reliable detection of regions
	most closely engaged in memory encoding. A variety of experimental
	designs have been used to detect encoding-related activity, including
	blocked, sparse event-related, and rapid event-related designs. Although
	blocked designs are generally more sensitive than event-related designs,
	design and analysis advantages could potentially overcome this difference.
	In the present study, we directly contrast different experimental
	designs in terms of the intensity, extent, and lateralization of
	activation detected in healthy subjects. Our results suggest that
	although improved design augments the sensitivity of event-related
	designs, these benefits are not sufficient to overcome the sensitivity
	advantages of traditional blocked designs.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish quantitative standards for the directionally
	averaged water apparent diffusion coefficient (D) and quantitative
	diffusion anisotropy (A sigma) of normal brains in newborns by using
	diffusion tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
	Diffusion tensor MR imaging was performed during the first 36 hours
	of life in 22 newborns (gestational age range, 31-41 weeks). Values
	of D and A sigma were measured in regions of interest chosen in the
	cortical gray matter, centrum semiovale, caudate nuclei, lentiform
	nuclei, thalami, internal capsules, and cerebellar hemispheres. RESULTS:
	The D values in the gray and white matter in newborns are considerably
	higher than those in adults. There is a striking correlation between
	gestational age and D, with D decreasing as gestational age increases.
	The A sigma values in the white matter in newborns are lower than
	those in adults. Values of A sigma show statistically significant
	correlations with gestational age only in the white matter of the
	centrum semiovale, in which A sigma values increase sharply near
	term. CONCLUSION: The D values primarily reflect overall brain water
	content. The A sigma values are more sensitive to tissue microstructure
	(e.g., white matter packing and myelination). The D and A sigma images
	reveal information and not apparent on T1- and T2-weighted images.},

	promise of understanding the topology, networks and ultimately the

	in neuroscience. High-throughput methods permit genome-wide searches
	to discover genes that are uniquely expressed in brain circuits and
	regions that control behavior. Previous gene expression mapping studies
	in model organisms have employed situ hybridization (ISH), a technique
	that uses labeled nucleic acid probes to bind to specific mRNA transcripts
	in tissue sections. A key requirement for this effort is the development
	of fast and robust algorithms for anatomically mapping and quantifying
	gene expression for ISH. We describe a neuroinformatics pipeline
	for automatically mapping expression profiles of ISH data and its
	use to produce the first genomic scale 3-D mapping of gene expression
	in a mammalian brain. The pipeline is fully automated and adaptable
	to other organisms and tissues. Our automated study of over 20,000
	genes indicates that at least 78.8 percent are expressed at some
	level in the adult C56BL/6J mouse brain. In addition to providing

	Abstract = {Requiring only minimal assumptions for validity, nonparametric permutation
	testing provides a flexible and intuitive methodology for the statistical
	analysis of data from functional neuroimaging experiments, at some
	computational expense. Introduced into the functional neuroimaging
	literature by Holmes et al. ([1996]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 16:7-22),
	the permutation approach readily accounts for the multiple comparisons
	problem implicit in the standard voxel-by-voxel hypothesis testing
	framework. When the appropriate assumptions hold, the nonparametric
	permutation approach gives results similar to those obtained from
	a comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach using a general
	linear model with multiple comparisons corrections derived from random
	field theory. For analyses with low degrees of freedom, such as single
	subject PET/SPECT experiments or multi-subject PET/SPECT or fMRI
	designs assessed for population effects, the nonparametric approach
	employing a locally pooled (smoothed) variance estimate can outperform
	the comparable Statistical Parametric Mapping approach. Thus, these
	nonparametric techniques can be used to verify the validity of less
	computationally expensive parametric approaches. Although the theory
	and relative advantages of permutation approaches have been discussed
	by various authors, there has been no accessible explication of the
	method, and no freely distributed software implementing it. Consequently,
	there have been few practical applications of the technique. This
	article, and the accompanying MATLAB software, attempts to address
	these issues. The standard nonparametric randomization and permutation
	testing ideas are developed at an accessible level, using practical
	examples from functional neuroimaging, and the extensions for multiple
	comparisons described. Three worked examples from PET and fMRI are
	presented, with discussion, and comparisons with standard parametric
	approaches made where appropriate. Practical considerations are given
	throughout, and relevant statistical concepts are expounded in appendices.},

	white matter fiber tracts. Using subject-specific tractography bundle
	segmentations, we generate an arc length parameterization of the
	bundle with point correspondences across all fibers and all subjects,
	allowing tract-based measurement and analysis. In this paper we present
	a quantitative comparison of fiber coordinate systems from the literature
	and we introduce an improved optimal match method that reduces spatial
	distortion and improves intra- and inter-subject variability of FA
	measurements. We propose a method for generating arc length correspondences
	across hemispheres, enabling a TBM study of interhemispheric diffusion
	asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and cingulum bundle (CB).
	The results of this study demonstrate that TBM can detect differences
	that may not be found by measuring means of scalar invariants in
	entire tracts, such as the mean diffusivity (MD) differences found
	in AF. We report TBM results of higher fractional anisotropy (FA)
	in the left hemisphere in AF (caused primarily by lower lambda(3),
	the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left AF),
	and higher left hemisphere FA in CB (related to higher lambda(1),
	the largest eigenvalue of the diffusion tensor, in the left CB).
	By mapping the significance levels onto the tractography trajectories
	for each structure, we demonstrate the anatomical locations of the
	interhemispheric differences. The TBM approach brings analysis of

@article{ogawa93,
	Abstract = {It recently has been demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging
	can be used to map changes in brain hemodynamics produced by human
	mental operations. One method under development relies on blood oxygenation
	level-dependent (BOLD) contrast: a change in the signal strength
	of brain water protons produced by the paramagnetic effects of venous
	blood deoxyhemoglobin. Here we discuss the basic quantitative features
	of the observed BOLD-based signal changes, including the signal amplitude
	and its magnetic field dependence and dynamic effects such as a pronounced
	oscillatory pattern that is induced in the signal from primary visual
	cortex during photic stimulation experiments. The observed features
	are compared with the results of Monte Carlo simulations of water
	proton intravoxel phase dispersion produced by local field gradients
	generated by paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin in nearby venous blood
	vessels. The simulations suggest that the effect of water molecule
	diffusion is strong for the case of blood capillaries, but, for larger
	venous blood vessels, water diffusion is not an important determinant
	of deoxyhemoglobin-induced signal dephasing. We provide an expression
	for the apparent in-plane relaxation rate constant (R2*) in terms
	of the main magnetic field strength, the degree of the oxygenation
	of the venous blood, the venous blood volume fraction in the tissue,
	and the size of the blood vessel.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subjects with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a
	memory impairment beyond that expected for age and education yet
	are not demented. These subjects are becoming the focus of many prediction
	studies and early intervention trials. OBJECTIVE: To characterize
	clinically subjects with MCI cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
	DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal inception cohort. SETTING: General
	community clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 76 consecutively evaluated
	subjects with MCI were compared with 234 healthy control subjects
	and 106 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), all from a community
	setting as part of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's
	Disease Patient Registry, Rochester, Minn. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
	The 3 groups of individuals were compared on demographic factors
	and measures of cognitive function including the Mini-Mental State
	Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler
	Memory Scale-Revised, Dementia Rating Scale, Free and Cued Selective
	Reminding Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Clinical classifications
	of dementia and AD were determined according to the Diagnostic and
	Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition and
	the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders
	and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association
	criteria, respectively. RESULTS: The primary distinction between
	control subjects and subjects with MCI was in the area of memory,
	while other cognitive functions were comparable. However, when the
	subjects with MCI were compared with the patients with very mild
	AD, memory performance was similar, but patients with AD were more
	impaired in other cognitive domains as well. Longitudinal performance
	demonstrated that the subjects with MCI declined at a rate greater
	than that of the controls but less rapidly than the patients with
	mild AD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the criteria for MCI can
	be differentiated from healthy control subjects and those with very
	mild AD. They appear to constitute a clinical entity that can be
	characterized for treatment interventions.},

	Abstract = {The field of functional neuroimaging (FNI) methodology has developed
	into a mature but evolving area of knowledge and its applications
	have been extensive. A general problem in the analysis of FNI data
	is finding a signal embedded in noise. This is sometimes called signal
	detection. Signal detection theory focuses in general on issues relating
	to the optimization of conditions for separating the signal from
	noise. When methods from probability theory and mathematical statistics
	are directly applied in this procedure it is also called statistical
	inference. In this paper we briefly discuss some aspects of signal
	detection theory relevant to FNI and, in addition, some common approaches
	to statistical inference used in FNI. Low-pass filtering in relation
	to functional-anatomical variability and some effects of filtering
	on signal detection of interest to FNI are discussed. Also, some
	general aspects of hypothesis testing and statistical inference are
	discussed. This includes the need for characterizing the signal in
	data when the null hypothesis is rejected, the problem of multiple
	comparisons that is central to FNI data analysis, omnibus tests and
	some issues related to statistical power in the context of FNI. In
	turn, random field, scale space, non-parametric and Monte Carlo approaches
	are reviewed, representing the most common approaches to statistical
	inference used in FNI. Complementary to these issues an overview
	and discussion of non-inferential descriptive methods, common statistical
	models and the problem of model selection is given in a companion
	paper. In general, model selection is an important prelude to subsequent
	statistical inference. The emphasis in both papers is on the assumptions
	and inherent limitations of the methods presented. Most of the methods
	described here generally serve their purposes well when the inherent
	assumptions and limitations are taken into account. Significant differences
	in results between different methods are most apparent in extreme
	parameter ranges, for example at low effective degrees of freedom
	or at small spatial autocorrelation. In such situations or in situations
	when assumptions and approximations are seriously violated it is
	of central importance to choose the most suitable method in order
	to obtain valid results.},

	Abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder,
	is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Current consensus
	statements have emphasized the need for early recognition and the
	fact that a diagnosis of AD can be made with high accuracy by using
	clinical, neuropsychologic, and imaging assessments. Magnetic resonance
	(MR) or computed tomographic (CT) imaging is recommended for the
	routine evaluation of AD. Coronal MR images can be useful to document
	or quantify atrophy of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, both
	of which occur early in the disease process. Both volumetric and
	subtraction MR techniques can be used to quantify and monitor dementia
	progression and rates of regional atrophy. MR measures are also increasingly
	being used to monitor treatment effects in clinical trials of cognitive
	enhancers and antidementia agents. Positron emission tomography (PET)
	and single photon emission CT offer value in the differential diagnosis
	of AD from other cortical and subcortical dementias and may also
	offer prognostic value. In addition, PET studies have demonstrated
	that subtle abnormalities may be apparent in the prodromal stages
	of AD and in subjects who carry susceptibility genes. PET ligands
	are in late-stage development for demonstration of amyloid plaques,

	Abstract = {Deformable shape models (DSMs) comprise a general approach that shows
	great promise for automatic image segmentation. Published studies
	by others and our own research results strongly suggest that segmentation
	of a normal or near-normal object from 3D medical images will be
	most successful when the DSM approach uses (1) knowledge of the geometry
	of not only the target anatomic object but also the ensemble of objects
	providing context for the target object and (2) knowledge of the
	image intensities to be expected relative to the geometry of the
	target and contextual objects. The segmentation will be most efficient
	when the deformation operates at multiple object-related scales and
	uses deformations that include not just local translations but the
	biologically important transformations of bending and twisting, i.e.,
	local rotation, and local magnification. In computer vision an important
	class of DSM methods uses explicit geometric models in a Bayesian
	statistical framework to provide a priori information used in posterior
	optimization to match the DSM against a target image. In this approach
	a DSM of the object to be segmented is placed in the target image
	data and undergoes a series of rigid and nonrigid transformations
	that deform the model to closely match the target object. The deformation
	process is driven by optimizing an objective function that has terms
	for the geometric typicality and model-to-image match for each instance
	of the deformed model. The success of this approach depends strongly
	on the object representation, i.e., the structural details and parameter
	set for the DSM, which in turn determines the analytic form of the
	objective function. This paper describes a form of DSM called m-reps
	that has or allows these properties, and a method of segmentation
	consisting of large to small scale posterior optimization of m-reps.
	Segmentation by deformable m-reps, together with the appropriate
	data representations, visualizations, and user interface, has been
	implemented in software that accomplishes 3D segmentations in a few
	minutes. Software for building and training models has also been
	developed. The methods underlying this software and its abilities
	are the subject of this paper.},

	The semiautomated component of this approach, which minimizes user

	and gain robustness to inter and intrarater variability and small
	errors in user labeling, by embedding the template-based normalization
	within a probabilistic framework that examines both label geometry
	and appearance data at each label. We evaluate the reliability of
	this framework with respect to manual labeling and show that it increases

	Abstract = {Functional and structural maps, such as a curvature, cortical thickness,
	and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps, indexed over
	the local coordinates of the cortical manifold play an important
	role in neuropsychiatric studies. Due to the highly convoluted nature
	of the cerebral cortex and image quality, these functions are generally
	uninterpretable without proper methods of association and smoothness
	onto the local coordinate system. In this paper, we generalized the
	spline smoothing problem (Wahba, 1990) from a sphere to any arbitrary
	two-dimensional (2-D) manifold with boundaries. We first seek a numerical
	solution to orthonormal basis functions of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB)
	operator with Neumann boundary conditions for a 2-D manifold M then
	solve the spline smoothing problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
	space (r.k.h.s.) of real-valued functions on manifold M with kernel
	constructed from the basis functions. The explicit discrete LB representation
	is derived using the finite element method calculated directly on
	the manifold coordinates so that finding discrete LB orthonormal
	basis functions is equivalent to solving an algebraic eigenvalue
	problem. And then smoothed functions in r.k.h.s can be represented
	as a linear combination of the basis functions. We demonstrate numerical
	solutions of spherical harmonics on a unit sphere and brain orthonormal
	basis functions on a planum temporale manifold. Then synthetic data
	is used to quantify the goodness of the smoothness compared with
	the ground truth and discuss how many basis functions should be incorporated
	in the smoothing. We present applications of our approach to smoothing
	sulcal mean curvature, cortical thickness, and functional statistical
	maps on submanifolds of the neocortex.},

	Abstract = {Temporal lobectomy is an effective therapy for medically refractory
	temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but may be complicated by amnestic
	syndromes. Therefore, pre-surgical evaluation to assess the risk/benefit
	ratio for surgery is required. Intracarotid amobarbital testing (IAT)
	is currently the most widely used method for assessing pre-surgical
	memory lateralization, but is relatively invasive. Over the past
	decade functional MRI (fMRI) has been shown to correlate with IAT
	for language lateralization, and also for memory lateralization in
	a small number of patients. This study was carried out to compare
	fMRI during memory encoding with IAT testing for memory lateralization,
	and to assess the predictive value of fMRI during memory encoding
	for post-surgical memory outcome. Thirty-five patients with refractory
	TLE undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for temporal lobectomy and
	30 normal subjects performed a complex visual scene-encoding task
	during fMRI scanning at 1.5 T using a 10-min protocol. Encoding performance
	was evaluated with subsequent recognition testing. Twenty-three patients
	also completed the same task again outside the scanner, an average
	of 6.9 months following surgery. A region of interest (ROI) analysis
	was used to quantify activation within hippocampal and a larger mesial
	temporal lobe ROI consisting of hippocampus, parahippocampus and
	fusiform gyrus (HPF) as defined by a published template. Normal subjects
	showed almost symmetrical activation within these ROI. TLE patients
	showed greater asymmetry. Asymmetry ratios (ARs) from the HPF ROI
	correlated significantly with memory lateralization by intracarotid
	amobarbital testing. HPF ARs also correlated significantly with memory
	outcome, as determined by a change in scene recognition between pre-surgical
	and post-surgical trials. When absolute activation within the HPF
	ROI was considered, a significant inverse correlation between activation
	ipsilateral to temporal lobectomy and memory outcome was observed,
	with no significant correlation in the contralateral HPF ROI. Although
	further technical improvements and prospective clinical validation
	are required, these results suggest that mesial temporal memory activation
	detected by fMRI during complex visual scene encoding correlates
	with post-surgical memory outcome and supports the notion that this
	approach will ultimately contribute to patient management.},

@article{ramsey01,
	Abstract = {Recent advances in functional neuroimaging techniques have prompted
	an increase in the number of studies investigating lateralization
	of language functions. One of the problems in relating findings of
	various studies to one another is the diversity of reported results.
	This may be due to differences in the tasks that are used to stimulate
	language processing regions and in the control tasks, as well as
	differences in the way imaging data are analyzed,in particular the
	threshold for significance of signal change. We present a simple
	method to assess language lateralization that allows for some variation
	of tasks and statistical thresholding, but at the same time yields
	reliable and reproducible results. Images acquired during a set of
	word-comprehension and -production tasks are analyzed conjointly.
	As opposed to the use of any one particular task, this combined task
	analysis (CTA) approach is geared toward identifying language regions
	that are involved in generic language functions rather than regions
	that are involved in functions that are specific to a single task.
	In two experiments CTA is compared to single-task analysis in healthy
	right-handed males. In a third experiment left-handed males were
	examined. Results indicate that CTA: (1) improves detection of language-related
	brain activity in individual subjects and (2) yields a high language
	laterality index (LI) in right-handed males with a small variance
	across subjects. The high LI matches the strong left-hemisphere dominance
	for language that is typical for these subjects as reported in neuropsychological
	and clinical tests in other studies. In the left-handed subjects
	dominance was found either in the left (n = 4) or the right (n =
	1) hemisphere or was absent (n = 3). The LI derived from CTA is more
	consistent across statistical thresholds for significance of signal
	change in fMRI analysis than in individual-task analysis. Also, the
	CTA results are very similar to those obtained with conjunction analysis
	of the same data.},

@article{rao05,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: A controlled observer study was conducted to compare a method
	for automatic image segmentation with conventional user-guided segmentation
	of right and left kidneys from planning computerized tomographic
	(CT) images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Deformable shape models called
	m-reps were used to automatically segment right and left kidneys
	from 12 target CT images, and the results were compared with careful
	manual segmentations performed by two human experts. M-rep models
	were trained based on manual segmentations from a collection of images
	that did not include the targets. Segmentation using m-reps began
	with interactive initialization to position the kidney model over
	the target kidney in the image data. Fully automatic segmentation
	proceeded through two stages at successively smaller spatial scales.
	At the first stage, a global similarity transformation of the kidney
	model was computed to position the model closer to the target kidney.
	The similarity transformation was followed by large-scale deformations
	based on principal geodesic analysis (PGA). During the second stage,
	the medial atoms comprising the m-rep model were deformed one by
	one. This procedure was iterated until no changes were observed.
	The transformations and deformations at both stages were driven by
	optimizing an objective function with two terms. One term penalized
	the currently deformed m-rep by an amount proportional to its deviation
	from the mean m-rep derived from PGA of the training segmentations.
	The second term computed a model-to-image match term based on the
	goodness of match of the trained intensity template for the currently
	deformed m-rep with the corresponding intensity data in the target
	image. Human and m-rep segmentations were compared using quantitative
	metrics provided in a toolset called Valmet. Metrics reported in
	this article include (1) percent volume overlap; (2) mean surface
	distance between two segmentations; and (3) maximum surface separation
	(Hausdorff distance). RESULTS: Averaged over all kidneys the mean
	surface separation was 0.12 cm, the mean Hausdorff distance was 0.99
	cm, and the mean volume overlap for human segmentations was 88.8\%.
	Between human and m-rep segmentations the mean surface separation
	was 0.18-0.19 cm, the mean Hausdorff distance was 1.14-1.25 cm, and
	the mean volume overlap was 82-83\%. CONCLUSIONS: Overall in this
	study, the best m-rep kidney segmentations were at least as good
	as careful manual slice-by-slice segmentations performed by two experienced
	humans, and the worst performance was no worse than typical segmentations
	from our clinical setting. The mean surface separations for human-m-rep
	segmentations were slightly larger than for human-human segmentations
	but still in the subvoxel range, and volume overlap and maximum surface
	separation were slightly better for human-human comparisons. These
	results were expected because of experimental factors that favored
	comparison of the human-human segmentations. In particular, m-rep
	agreement with humans appears to have been limited largely by fundamental
	differences between manual slice-by-slice and true three-dimensional
	segmentation, imaging artifacts, image voxel dimensions, and the
	use of an m-rep model that produced a smooth surface across the renal
	pelvis.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) was used to determine

	precursor protein (APP) V717F under control of platelet-derived growth
	factor promoter (PDAPP mice), and cortical and hippocampal beta-amyloid
	(Abeta) deposits accumulate in heterozygotes after 8-10 mos. We used
	MRM to obtain 3D volumetric data on mouse brains imaged in their
	skulls to define genotype- and age-related changes. Hippocampal,
	cerebellar, and brain volumes and corpus callosum length were quantified
	in 40-, 100-, 365-, and 630-day-old mice. Measurements taken at age
	100 days, before Abeta deposition, revealed a 12.3\% reduction of
	hippocampus volume in Tg mice compared with WT controls. This reduction
	persisted without progression to age 21 mos. A significant 18\% increase
	in hippocampal volume occurred between 40 and 630 days in WT mice,
	and no corresponding significant increase occurred in Tg mice. Cavalieri
	volume estimates of hippocampal subfields from 100-day-old Tg mice
	further localized a 28\% volume deficit in the dentate gyrus. In
	addition, corpus callosum length was reduced by approximately 25\%
	in Tg mice at all ages analyzed. In summary, reduced hippocampal
	volume and corpus callosum length can be detected by MRM before Abeta
	deposition. We conclude that overexpression of APP and amyloid may

	novel targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and further
	reinforcing the need for early diagnosis and treatment.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: An optimal technique for clinical memory fMRI is not established.
	Previous studies suggest activity in right parahippocampal gyrus
	and right hippocampus shows the strongest difference between left
	hippocampal sclerosis (HS) patients and normal control subjects and
	that the difference in activity between left and right hippocampus
	predicts postoperative memory change. METHODS: The authors studied
	30 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) and left HS,
	12 of whom subsequently underwent surgery, and 13 normal control
	subjects. The patients who had surgery underwent neuropsychometric
	evaluation pre- and postoperatively. All subjects underwent a verbal
	memory encoding event-related fMRI study. Activation maps were assessed
	visually. Subsequently, the brain regions involved in the memory
	task were revealed by group averaging; these regions were used to
	determine regions of interest (ROIs) for subsequent analysis. By
	use of stepwise discriminant function and stepwise multiple regression,
	the ROIs that optimally discriminated between patients and normal
	control subjects and that optimally predicted postoperative verbal
	memory outcome were determined. RESULTS: Visual inspection of individual
	patient activation statistic maps revealed noisy data that did not
	afford visual interpretation. Stepwise discriminant function revealed
	the difference between left and right hippocampal activity best discriminated
	between patients and normal control subjects. Stepwise multiple regression
	revealed left hippocampal activity was the strongest predictor of
	postoperative verbal memory outcome; greater left hippocampal activity
	predicted a greater postoperative decline in memory. CONCLUSIONS:
	Patients with left hippocampal sclerosis (HS) differ from normal
	control subjects in the distribution of memory-encoding activity
	between left and right hippocampus. Functional adequacy of left hippocampus
	best predicts postoperative memory outcome in left HS.},

	All algorithms produced virtually identical overlaps of corresponding

	even with perfect overlap of corresponding structures, the statistics
	of Jacobian values are affected by bias due to design elements of
	the particular nonrigid registration. These findings are not limited

	Abstract = {This paper evaluates strategies for atlas selection in atlas-based
	segmentation of three-dimensional biomedical images. Segmentation
	by intensity-based nonrigid registration to atlas images is applied
	to confocal microscopy images acquired from the brains of 20 bees.
	This paper evaluates and compares four different approaches for atlas
	image selection: registration to an individual atlas image (IND),
	registration to an average-shape atlas image (AVG), registration
	to the most similar image from a database of individual atlas images
	(SIM), and registration to all images from a database of individual
	atlas images with subsequent multi-classifier decision fusion (MUL).
	The MUL strategy is a novel application of multi-classifier techniques,
	which are common in pattern recognition, to atlas-based segmentation.
	For each atlas selection strategy, the segmentation performance of
	the algorithm was quantified by the similarity index (SI) between
	the automatic segmentation result and a manually generated gold standard.
	The best segmentation accuracy was achieved using the MUL paradigm,
	which resulted in a mean similarity index value between manual and
	automatic segmentation of 0.86 (AVG, 0.84; SIM, 0.82; IND, 0.81).
	The superiority of the MUL strategy over the other three methods
	is statistically significant (two-sided paired t test, P < 0.001).
	Both the MUL and AVG strategies performed better than the best possible
	SIM and IND strategies with optimal a posteriori atlas selection
	(mean similarity index for optimal SIM, 0.83; for optimal IND, 0.81).
	Our findings show that atlas selection is an important issue in atlas-based
	segmentation and that, in particular, multi-classifier techniques
	can substantially increase the segmentation accuracy.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we show how the concept of statistical deformation
	models (SDMs) can be used for the construction of average models
	of the anatomy and their variability. SDMs are built by performing
	a statistical analysis of the deformations required to map anatomical
	features in one subject into the corresponding features in another
	subject. The concept of SDMs is similar to statistical shape models
	(SSMs) which capture statistical information about shapes across
	a population, but offers several advantages over SSMs. First, SDMs
	can be constructed directly from images such as three-dimensional
	(3-D) magnetic resonance (MR) or computer tomography volumes without
	the need for segmentation which is usually a prerequisite for the
	construction of SSMs. Instead, a nonrigid registration algorithm
	based on free-form deformations and normalized mutual information
	is used to compute the deformations required to establish dense correspondences
	between the reference subject and the subjects in the population
	class under investigation. Second, SDMs allow the construction of
	an atlas of the average anatomy as well as its variability across
	a population of subjects. Finally, SDMs take the 3-D nature of the
	underlying anatomy into account by analysing dense 3-D deformation
	fields rather than only information about the surface shape of anatomical
	structures. We show results for the construction of anatomical models
	of the brain from the MR images of 25 different subjects. The correspondences
	obtained by the nonrigid registration are evaluated using anatomical
	landmark locations and show an average error of 1.40 mm at these
	anatomical landmark positions. We also demonstrate that SDMs can
	be constructed so as to minimize the bias toward the chosen reference
	subject.},

	Abstract = {Due to the reported variability of the language laterality index (LI)
	across fMRI studies, reliable distinction between patients with unilateral
	and mixed language dominance is currently not possible, preventing
	clinical implementation of fMRI as a replacement for the invasive
	Wada test. Variability of the LI may be related to differences in
	experimental and control tasks, and statistical methodology. The
	goal of this study was to improve detection power of fMRI for hemispheric
	language dominance by using a combined analysis of four different
	language tasks (CTA), that has previously shown more reliable and
	robust Lls in groups of normal volunteers than individual task analyses
	(see Ramsey et al). The CTA targets brain areas that are common to
	different language tasks, thereby focusing on areas that are critical
	for language processing. Further advantage of the CTA is that it
	is relatively independent of specific task and control conditions.
	18 patients with typical (i.e., left-sided, n = 11) and atypical
	(i.e., right-sided or mixed, respectively, n = 3 and n = 4) language
	dominance according to the Wada test underwent fMRI (groups respectively
	denoted as WadaL, WadaR, and WadaM patients). Statistical methodology
	(including thresholding of activity maps) was fixed to assure a user-independent
	approach. CTA yielded better results than any of the individual task
	analyses: it was more robust (on average 2.5 times more brain activity
	was detected due to its higher statistical power) and more reliable
	(concordance for WadaL, WadaM and WadaR patients was respectively
	10/11 (91\%), 3/4 (75\%), and 2/3 patients (67\%)). Overall, a significant
	correlation was observed between frontal and temporoparietal LIs.
	Remarkably, brain activity for WadaM patients was significantly lower
	than for WadaL or WadaR patients, and a dissociation in lateralization
	was observed between frontal (right-sided) and temporoparietal (left-sided)
	activity in three of four patients. Of the individual task analyses,
	the verb generation task yielded best results for patients with unilateral
	language dominance (same concordance as CTA). However, in contrast
	to CTA results, the verb generation task was unable to identify WadaM
	patients (concordance in one of four patients). In conclusion, the
	CTA is a promising approach for clinical implementation of fMRI for
	the prediction of hemispheric language dominance.},

	to 48 years, investigated for intractable partial epilepsy. Epileptic
	focus location was temporal in 14 cases, extratemporal in 6, and
	lateralized in the left hemisphere in 11/20. Hemispheric dominance
	for language was evaluated by both Wada test and fMRI using a silent

	index was calculated from the number of activated pixels (Student's
	t test, P < 0.0001) in the right and left hemispheres. The Wada test
	showed a right hemispheric dominance in 8 patients (6 were left handed

	Abstract = {Hippocampal volume change over time, measured with MRI, has huge potential
	as a marker for Alzheimer's disease. The objectives of this study
	were: (i) to test if constant and accelerated hippocampal loss can
	be detected in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and
	normal ageing over short periods, e.g. 6-12 months, with MRI in the
	large multicentre setting of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
	Initiative (ADNI); (ii) to determine the extent to which the polymorphism
	of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene modulates hippocampal change;
	and (iii) to determine if rates of hippocampal loss correlate with
	cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, such
	as the beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)) and tau proteins (tau). The MRI
	multicentre study included 112 cognitive normal elderly individuals,
	226 mild cognitive impairment and 96 Alzheimer's disease patients
	who all had at least three successive MRI scans, involving 47 different
	imaging centres. The mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease
	groups showed hippocampal volume loss over 6 months and accelerated
	loss over 1 year. Moreover, increased rates of hippocampal loss were
	associated with presence of the ApoE allele epsilon4 gene in Alzheimer's
	disease and lower CSF Abeta(1-42) in mild cognitive impairment, irrespective
	of ApoE genotype, whereas relations with tau were only trends. The
	power to measure hippocampal change was improved by exploiting correlations
	statistically between successive MRI observations. The demonstration
	of considerable hippocampal loss in mild cognitive impairment and
	Alzheimer's disease patients over only 6 months and accelerated loss
	over 12 months illustrates the power of MRI to track morphological
	brain changes over time in a large multisite setting. Furthermore,
	the relations between faster hippocampal loss in the presence of
	ApoE allele epsilon4 and decreased CSF Abeta(1-42) supports the concept
	that increased hippocampal loss is an indicator of Alzheimer's disease
	pathology and a potential marker for the efficacy of therapeutic
	interventions in Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Develop a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker signature for mild
	Alzheimer's disease (AD) in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
	(ADNI) subjects. METHODS: Amyloid-beta 1 to 42 peptide (A beta(1-42)),
	total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 were
	measured in (1) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained during
	baseline evaluation of 100 mild AD, 196 mild cognitive impairment,
	and 114 elderly cognitively normal (NC) subjects in ADNI; and (2)
	independent 56 autopsy-confirmed AD cases and 52 age-matched elderly
	NCs using a multiplex immunoassay. Detection of an AD CSF profile
	for t-tau and A beta(1-42) in ADNI subjects was achieved using receiver
	operating characteristic cut points and logistic regression models
	derived from the autopsy-confirmed CSF data. RESULTS: CSF A beta(1-42)
	was the most sensitive biomarker for AD in the autopsy cohort of
	CSF samples: receiver operating characteristic area under the curve
	of 0.913 and sensitivity for AD detection of 96.4\%. In the ADNI
	cohort, a logistic regression model for A beta(1-42), t-tau, and

	of mild AD. An AD-like baseline CSF profile for t-tau/A beta(1-42)
	was detected in 33 of 37 ADNI mild cognitive impairment subjects
	who converted to probable AD during the first year of the study.
	INTERPRETATION: The CSF biomarker signature of AD defined by A beta(1-42)
	and t-tau in the autopsy-confirmed AD cohort and confirmed in the
	cohort followed in ADNI for 12 months detects mild AD in a large,
	multisite, prospective clinical investigation, and this signature
	appears to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD.},

	Abstract = {A method for segmentation and quantification of the shape and size

	representation of its boundary. The deformable model combines three
	types of information. First, it employs information about the geometric
	properties of the hippocampal boundary, from a local and relatively
	finer scale to a more global and relatively coarser scale. Second,
	the model includes a statistical characterization of normal shape
	variation across individuals, serving as prior knowledge to the algorithm.
	Third, the algorithm utilizes a number of manually defined boundary
	points, which can help guide the model deformation to the appropriate
	boundaries, wherever these boundaries are weak or not clearly defined
	in MR images. Excellent agreement is demonstrated between the algorithm
	and manual segmentations by well-trained raters, with a correlation
	coefficient equal to 0.97 and algorithm/rater differences statistically

@article{shenton02,
	Abstract = {Evidence suggests that some structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia
	are neurodevelopmental in origin. There is also growing evidence
	to suggest that shape deformations in brain structure may reflect
	abnormalities in neurodevelopment. While many magnetic resonance
	(MR) imaging studies have investigated brain area and volume measures
	in schizophrenia, fewer have focused on shape deformations. In this
	MR study we used a 3D shape representation technique, based on spherical
	harmonic functions, to analyze left and right amygdala-hippocampus
	shapes in each of 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls
	matched for age, gender, handedness and parental socioeconomic status.
	Left/right asymmetry was also measured for both shape and volume
	differences. Additionally, shape and volume measurements were combined
	in a composite analysis. There were no differences between groups
	in overall volume or shape. Left/right amygdala-hippocampal asymmetry,
	however, was significantly larger in patients than controls for both
	relative volume and shape. The local brain regions responsible for
	the left/right asymmetry differences in patients with schizophrenia
	were in the tail of the hippocampus (including both the inferior
	aspect adjacent to parahippocampal gyrus and the superior aspect
	adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus and more anteriorly to
	the cerebral peduncles) and in portions of the amygdala body (including
	the anterior-superior aspect adjacent to the basal nucleus). Also,
	in patients, increased volumetric asymmetry tended to be correlated
	with increased left/right shape asymmetry. Furthermore, a combined
	analysis of volume and shape asymmetry resulted in improved differentiation
	between groups. Classification function analyses correctly classified
	70\% of cases using volume, 73.3\% using shape, and 87\% using combined
	volume and shape measures. These findings suggest that shape provides
	important new information toward characterizing the pathophysiology
	of schizophrenia, and that combining volume and shape measures provides
	improved group discrimination in studies investigating brain abnormalities
	in schizophrenia. An evaluation of shape deformations also suggests
	local abnormalities in the amygdala-hippocampal complex in schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {The clinical identification and differential diagnosis of dementias
	is especially challenging in the early stages, but the need for early,
	accurate diagnosis has become more important, now that several medications
	for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) are
	available. Many neurodegenerative diseases produce significant brain-function
	alterations detectable with PET or SPECT even when structural images
	with CT or MRI reveal no specific abnormalities. (18)F-FDG PET images
	of AD demonstrate focally decreased cerebral metabolism involving
	especially the posterior cingulate and neocortical association cortices,
	while largely sparing the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, and
	cortex mediating primary sensory and motor functions. Assessment
	of the precise diagnostic accuracy of PET had until recently been
	hindered by the paucity of data on diagnoses made using PET and confirmed
	by definitive histopathologic examination. In the past few years,
	however, studies comparing neuropathologic examination with PET have
	established reliable and consistent accuracy for diagnostic evaluations
	using PET-accuracies substantially exceeding those of comparable
	studies of the diagnostic value of SPECT or of both modalities assessed
	side by side, or of clinical evaluations done without nuclear imaging.
	Similar data are emerging concerning the prognostic value of (18)F-FDG
	PET. Improvements in the ability of PET to identify very early changes
	associated with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias are currently
	outpacing improvements in therapeutic options, but with advances

	expresses a unique molecular profile accounting for their differential
	vulnerability to mechanisms of memory dysfunction. Nevertheless,
	it remains unclear which hippocampal subregion is most sensitive

	by using separate imaging techniques, each assessing different correlates

	an established correlate of basal metabolism, in the hippocampal
	subregions of young and old rhesus monkeys. Second, we used in situ
	hybridization to map Arc expression in the hippocampal subregions
	of young and old rats. Arc is an immediate early gene that is activated
	in a behavior-dependent manner and is correlated with spike activity.
	Results show that the dentate gyrus is the hippocampal subregion
	most sensitive to the effects of advancing age, which together with
	prior studies establishes a cross-species consensus. This pattern
	isolates the locus of age-related hippocampal dysfunction and differentiates

	Abstract = {Memory ability declines in older age groups. There is a growing list
	of physiological processes that target the hippocampal formation
	in an age-related fashion, and some might underlie the hippocampal
	component of memory decline. The hippocampal formation is comprised
	of separate subregions, and physiological processes differentially
	target these subregions. The ability to evaluate the functional integrity
	of individual subregions-performing subregional analysis-is a major
	clinical goal since it can aid in the diagnosis of memory decline,
	as well as in elucidating mechanisms of disease and testing potential
	interventions. Because of its superior spatial resolution, magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI) is best suited to accomplish this goal. Despite
	limited success, most functional MRI (fMRI) protocols have difficulty
	in performing complete subregional analysis of the hippocampal formation.
	Here we address sources of difficulty by (1) generating T2* -weighted
	maps of the hippocampal formation with sub-millimeter resolution;
	and (2) by adapting an approach used by animal investigators to identify
	the hippocampal subregions using anatomical landmarks. The protocol
	is tested in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in healthy controls,
	in an effort to determine whether it can detect neuronal dysfunction.
	Results showed diminished signal in the hippocampal formation of
	patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to controls, and
	multivariate analysis showed that this difference was most prominent
	in the entorhinal cortex. The protocol can be used to perform subregional
	analysis of the hippocampal formation. Testing the protocol in other
	clinical populations is needed to demonstrate its efficacy in evaluating
	the neuronal integrity of all hippocampal subregions.},

	Abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion
	imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the
	brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter
	tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion
	data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly
	directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are
	starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order
	to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and
	disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard
	registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory
	solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple
	subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from
	the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness
	of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved.
	In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues
	via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b)
	projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the
	"mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based
	Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity,

	The analysis included concurrent factors that might also affect outcome,

	The magnitude of the difference in performance between the two hemispheres

	Medical anatomy courses utilize cadavers to approximate the live

	Abstract = {Knowledge about the biological variability of anatomical objects is
	essential for statistical shape analysis and discrimination between
	healthy and pathological structures. This paper describes a novel
	approach that incorporates the variability of an object population
	into the generation of a characteristic 3D shape model. The proposed
	shape representation is a coarse-scale sampled medial description
	derived from a fine-scale spherical harmonics (SPHARM) boundary description.
	This medial description is composed of a net of medial samples (m-rep)
	with fixed graph properties. The medial model is computed automatically
	from a predefined shape space using pruned 3D Voronoi skeletons.
	A new method determines the stable medial branching topology from
	the shape space. An intrinsic coordinate system and an implicit correspondence
	between shapes is defined on the medial manifold. Several studies
	of biological structures clearly demonstrate that the novel representation
	has the promise to describe shape changes in a natural and intuitive
	way. A new medial shape similarity study of group differences between
	monozygotic and dizygotic twins in lateral ventricle shape demonstrates
	the meaningful and powerful representation of local and global form.},

	Abstract = {Statistical shape analysis has become of increasing interest to the
	neuroimaging community due to its potential to precisely locate morphological
	changes and thus potentially discriminate between healthy and pathological
	structures. This paper describes a combined boundary and medial shape
	analysis based on two different shape descriptions applied to a study
	of the hippocampus shape abnormalities in schizophrenia. The first
	shape description is the sampled boundary implied by the spherical
	harmonic SPHARM description. The second one is the medial shape description
	called M-rep. Both descriptions are sampled descriptions with inherent
	point correspondence. Their shape analysis is based on computing
	differences from an average template structure analyzed using standard
	group mean difference tests. The results of the global and local
	shape analysis in the presented hippocampus study exhibit the same
	patterns for the boundary and the medial analysis. The results strongly
	suggest that the normalized hippocampal shape of the schizophrenic
	group is different from the control group, most significantly as
	a deformation difference in the tail region.},

	Abstract = {The medial model is a powerful shape representation method that models
	a 3D object by explicitly defining its skeleton (medial axis) and
	deriving the boundary geometry according to medial geometry. It has
	been recently extended to model complex shapes with multi-figures,
	i.e., shapes whose skeletons can not be described by a single sheet
	in 3D. This paper applied the medial model to a 2-chamber heart data
	set consisting of 428 cardiac shapes from 90 subjects. The results
	show that the medial model can capture the heart shape accurately.
	To demonstrate the usage of the medial model, the changes of the
	heart wall thickness over time are analyzed. We calculated the mean
	heart wall thickness map of 90 subjects for different phases of the
	cardiac cycle, as well as the mean thickness change between phases.},

	Abstract = {The lungs are highly elastic organs, composed of a variety of structures:
	vasculature, airways and parenchyma. The unique mechanical properties
	of each of these structures form the composite material of the lung.
	Numerous pulmonary diseases affect these material properties. Clinically,
	these structural changes cannot be directly quantified. However,
	medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic
	resonance imaging can be used to observe lung morphology. It would
	be helpful to be able to correlate regional morphological changes
	with changes in pulmonary function. We present an approach toward
	the quantification of pulmonary deformation via non-rigid registration
	of serial MR images of the lung using the variational framework implemented
	in the Insight toolkit. Conventional registration methods, as exemplified
	by a finite element implementation of the classic elastic matching
	technique, are shown to perform well over a set of vascular landmarks
	in the measurement of lung motion. This performance is maintained
	in an augmented system, which combines inhomogeneous material properties
	with the use of domain discretizations tailored to reflect the apparent
	geometry within the image and to reduce background effects. These
	adaptations lay the groundwork for biomechanical modeling of the
	lung using the finite element method.},

	Abstract = {In this work, a number of important issues associated with fast spin
	echo (FSE) imaging of the human brain at 4.7 T are addressed. It
	is shown that FSE enables the acquisition of images with high resolution
	and good tissue contrast throughout the brain at high field strength.
	By employing an echo spacing (ES) of 22 ms, one can use large flip
	angle refocusing pulses (162 degrees ) and a low acquisition bandwidth
	(50 kHz) to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). A new method
	of phase encode (PE) ordering (called "feathering") designed to reduce
	image artifacts is described, and the contributions of RF (B(1))
	inhomogeneity, different echo coherence pathways, and magnetization
	transfer (MT) to FSE signal intensity and contrast are investigated.
	B(1) inhomogeneity is measured and its effect is shown to be relatively
	minor for high-field FSE, due to the self-compensating characteristics
	of the sequence. Thirty-four slice data sets (slice thickness = 2
	mm; in-plane resolution = 0.469 mm; acquisition time = 11 min 20
	s) from normal volunteers are presented, which allow visualization
	of brain anatomy in fine detail. This study demonstrates that high-field
	FSE produces images of the human brain with high spatial resolution,

	Abstract = {The cellular hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) accumulate in the
	living brain up to 30 years before the characteristic symptoms of
	dementia can be identified. Brain changes in AD are difficult to
	distinguish from those in normal ageing, and this has led to the
	development of powerful computational methods to extract statistical
	information on the brain changes that are characteristic of AD, mild
	cognitive impairment (MCI) and different dementia subtypes. Time-lapse
	maps can be built to show how the disease spreads in the brain, and
	where treatment affects the disease trajectory. Here, we review three
	computational approaches to map brain deficits in AD: cortical thickness
	maps, tensor-based morphometry and hippocampal/ventricular surface
	modelling. Anatomical structures, modelled as three-dimensional geometrical
	surfaces, are mathematically combined across subjects for group or
	interval comparisons. Mathematical concepts from computational surface
	modelling, fluid mechanics and multivariate statistics are exploited
	to distinguish disease from normal variations in brain structure.
	These methods yield insight into the dynamics of AD and MCI, showing
	where brain changes correlate with cognitive or behavioural changes
	such as language dysfunction or apathy. We describe cortical and
	hippocampal changes that distinguish dementia subtypes (such as Lewy-body
	dementia, HIV-associated dementia and AD), and we describe brain
	changes that predict recovery or decline in those at risk. Finally,
	we indicate which computational methods are powerful enough to track
	dementia in clinical trials, on the basis of their efficiency and
	sensitivity to early change, and the detail in the measures they
	provide.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes algorithms that can identify patterns of brain
	structure and function associated with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia,
	normal aging, and abnormal brain development based on imaging data
	collected in large human populations. Extraordinary information can
	be discovered with these techniques: dynamic brain maps reveal how
	the brain grows in childhood, how it changes in disease, and how
	it responds to medication. Genetic brain maps can reveal genetic
	influences on brain structure, shedding light on the nature-nurture
	debate, and the mechanisms underlying inherited neurobehavioral disorders.
	Recently, we created time-lapse movies of brain structure for a variety
	of diseases. These identify complex, shifting patterns of brain structural
	deficits, revealing where, and at what rate, the path of brain deterioration
	in illness deviates from normal. Statistical criteria can then identify
	situations in which these changes are abnormally accelerated, or
	when medication or other interventions slow them. In this paper,
	we focus on describing our approaches to map structural changes in
	the cortex. These methods have already been used to reveal the profile
	of brain anomalies in studies of dementia, epilepsy, depression,
	childhood- and adult-onset schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity
	disorder, fetal alcohol syndrome, Tourette syndrome, Williams syndrome,
	and in methamphetamine abusers. Specifically, we describe an image
	analysis pipeline known as cortical pattern matching that helps compare
	and pool cortical data over time and across subjects. Statistics
	are then defined to identify brain structural differences between
	groups, including localized alterations in cortical thickness, gray
	matter density (GMD), and asymmetries in cortical organization. Subtle
	features, not seen in individual brain scans, often emerge when population-based
	brain data are averaged in this way. Illustrative examples are presented
	to show the profound effects of development and various diseases
	on the human cortex. Dynamically spreading waves of gray matter loss
	are tracked in dementia and schizophrenia, and these sequences are

	Abstract = {We report the first detailed population-based maps of cortical gray
	matter loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing prominent features
	of early structural change. New computational approaches were used
	to: (i) distinguish variations in gray matter distribution from variations
	in gyral patterns; (ii) encode these variations in a brain atlas
	(n = 46); (iii) create detailed maps localizing gray matter differences
	across groups. High resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
	volumes were acquired from 26 subjects with mild to moderate AD (age
	75.8+/-1.7 years, MMSE score 20.0+/-0.9) and 20 normal elderly controls
	(72.4+/-1.3 years) matched for age, sex, handedness and educational
	level. Image data were aligned into a standardized coordinate space
	specifically developed for an elderly population. Eighty-four anatomical
	models per brain, based on parametric surface meshes, were created
	for all 46 subjects. Structures modeled included: cortical surfaces,
	all major superficial and deep cortical sulci, callosal and hippocampal
	surfaces, 14 ventricular regions and 36 gyral boundaries. An elastic
	warping approach, driven by anatomical features, was then used to
	measure gyral pattern variations. Measures of gray matter distribution
	were made in corresponding regions of cortex across all 46 subjects.
	Statistical variations in cortical patterning, asymmetry, gray matter
	distribution and average gray matter loss were then encoded locally
	across the cortex. Maps of group differences were generated. Average
	maps revealed complex profiles of gray matter loss in disease. Greatest
	deficits (20-30\% loss, P<0.001-0.0001) were mapped in the temporo-parietal
	cortices. The sensorimotor and occipital cortices were comparatively
	spared (0-5\% loss, P>0.05). Gray matter loss was greater in the
	left hemisphere, with different patterns in the heteromodal and idiotypic
	cortex. Gyral pattern variability also differed in cortical regions
	appearing at different embryonic phases. 3D mapping revealed profiles
	of structural deficits consistent with the cognitive, metabolic and
	histological changes in early AD. These deficits can therefore be
	(i) charted in a living population and (ii) compared across individuals
	and groups, facilitating longitudinal, genetic and interventional
	studies of dementia.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Cholinesterase inhibitors are the primary treatment for the
	cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Cholinergic dysfunction
	is also associated with neuropsychiatric and functional deficits,
	but results from randomized controlled trials of cholinesterase inhibitors
	are conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis
	to quantify the efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors for neuropsychiatric
	and functional outcomes in patients with mild to moderate AD. DATA
	SOURCES: We performed a literature search of trials using MEDLINE
	(January 1966-December 2001), Dissertations Abstracts On-line, PSYCHINFO,
	BIOSIS, PubMed, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. We retrieved
	English- and non-English-language articles for review and collected
	references from bibliographies of reviews, original research articles,
	and other articles of interest. We searched for both published and
	unpublished trials, contacting researchers and pharmaceutical companies.
	STUDY SELECTION: We included 29 parallel-group or crossover randomized,
	double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of outpatients who were diagnosed
	as having mild to moderate probable AD and were treated for at least
	1 month with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Sixteen trials included
	neuropsychiatric and 18 included functional measures. DATA EXTRACTION:
	Two investigators (N.H.T. and J.H.) independently extracted study
	methods, sources of bias, and outcomes. Neuropsychiatric outcomes
	were measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, 0-120 points)
	and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, noncognitive (ADAS-noncog,
	0-50 points) and were analyzed with the weighted mean difference
	method. Functional outcomes were measured with several activities
	of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living
	(IADL) scales and analyzed with the standardized mean difference
	method. DATA SYNTHESIS: For neuropsychiatric outcomes, 10 trials
	included the ADAS-noncog and 6 included the NPI. Compared with placebo,
	patients randomized to cholinesterase inhibitors improved 1.72 points
	on the NPI (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-2.57 points), and
	0.03 points on the ADAS-noncog (95\% CI, 0.00-0.05 points). For functional
	outcomes, 14 trials used ADL and 13 trials used IADL scales. Compared
	with placebo, patients randomized to cholinesterase inhibitors improved
	0.1 SDs on ADL scales (95\% CI, 0.00-0.19 SDs), and 0.09 SDs on IADL
	scales (95\% CI, 0.01 to 0.17 SDs). There was no difference in efficacy
	among various cholinesterase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: These results
	indicate that cholinesterase inhibitors have a modest beneficial
	impact on neuropsychiatric and functional outcomes for patients with
	AD. Future research should focus on how such improvements translate
	into long-term outcomes such as patient quality of life, institutionalization,
	and caregiver burden.},

	sense and why it and its ramifications should be vigorously pursued.
	We review and compare declarative and episodic theories of amnesia,
	and argue that the findings reported by Vargha-Khadem and her colleagues
	fit well into an episodic theory that retains components already
	publicized, and adds new ones suggested by the Vargha-Khadem et al.
	study. Existing components of this theory include the idea that acquisition
	of factual knowledge can occur independently of episodic memory,
	and the idea that in anterograde amnesia it is quite possible for
	episodic memory to be more severely impaired than semantic memory.
	We suggest a realignment of organization of memory such that declarative
	memory is defined in terms of features and properties that are common
	to both episodic and semantic memory. The organization of memory
	thus modified gives greater precision to the Vargha-Khadem et al.
	neuroanatomical model in which declarative memory depends on perihippocampal
	cortical regions but not on the hippocampus, whereas episodic memory,
	which is separate from declarative memory, depends on the hippocampus.},

	high-resolution T1 volume provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute
	(MNI) (D. L. Collins et al., 1998, Trans. Med. Imag. 17, 463-468)
	was performed. The MNI single-subject main sulci were first delineated
	and further used as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical
	volumes of interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was
	performed using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following

	slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI were
	reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation method,
	three procedures to perform the automated anatomical labeling of
	functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an extremum defined
	by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of voxels belonging to each
	of the AVOI intersected by a sphere centered by a set of coordinates,

	Abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the white matter. Magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI) is proven to be a sensitive method of monitoring
	the progression of this disease and of its changes due to treatment
	protocols. Quantification of the severity of the disease through
	estimation of MS lesion volume via MR imaging is vital for understanding
	and monitoring the disease and its treatment. This paper presents
	a novel methodology and a system that can be routinely used for segmenting
	and estimating the volume of MS lesions via dual-echo fast spin-echo
	MR imagery. A recently developed concept of fuzzy objects forms the
	basis of this methodology. An operator indicates a few points in
	the images by pointing to the white matter, the grey matter, and
	the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF). Each of these objects is then detected
	as a fuzzy connected set. The holes in the union of these objects
	correspond to potential lesion sites which are utilized to detect
	each potential lesion as a three-dimensional (3-D) fuzzy connected
	object. These objects are presented to the operator who indicates
	acceptance/rejection through the click of a mouse button. The number
	and volume of accepted lesions is then computed and output. Based
	on several evaluation studies, we conclude that the methodology is
	highly reliable and consistent, with a coefficient of variation (due
	to subjective operator actions) of 0.9\% (based on 20 patient studies,
	three operators, and two trials) for volume and a mean false-negative
	volume fraction of 1.3\%, with a 95\% confidence interval of 0\%-2.8\%

	Abstract = {Recent developments in MRI data acquisition technology are starting
	to yield images that show anatomical features of the hippocampal
	formation at an unprecedented level of detail, providing the basis
	for hippocampal subfield measurement. However, a fundamental bottleneck
	in MRI studies of the hippocampus at the subfield level is that they
	currently depend on manual segmentation, a laborious process that
	severely limits the amount of data that can be analyzed. In this
	article, we present a computational method for segmenting the hippocampal
	subfields in ultra-high resolution MRI data in a fully automated
	fashion. Using Bayesian inference, we use a statistical model of
	image formation around the hippocampal area to obtain automated segmentations.
	We validate the proposed technique by comparing its segmentations
	to corresponding manual delineations in ultra-high resolution MRI
	scans of 10 individuals, and show that automated volume measurements
	of the larger subfields correlate well with manual volume estimates.
	Unlike manual segmentations, our automated technique is fully reproducible,

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Volumetric studies have reported reductions in the size
	of the corpus callosum (CC) in autism, but the callosal regions contributing
	to this deficit have differed among studies. In this study, a computational
	method was used to detect and map the spatial pattern of CC abnormalities
	in male patients with autism. METHODS: Twenty-four boys with autism
	(aged 10.0 +/- 3.3 years) and 26 control boys (aged 11.0 +/- 2.5
	years) underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at 3 Tesla.
	Total and regional areas of the CC were determined using traditional
	morphometric methods. Three-dimensional (3D) surface models of the
	CC were also created from the MRI scans. Statistical maps were created
	to visualize morphologic variability of the CC and to localize regions
	of callosal thinning in autism. RESULTS: Traditional morphometric
	methods detected a significant reduction in the total callosal area
	and in the anterior third of the CC in patients with autism; however,
	3D maps revealed significant reductions in both the splenium and
	genu of the CC in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Statistical maps of the
	CC revealed callosal deficits in autism with greater precision than
	traditional morphometric methods. These abnormalities suggest aberrant
	connections between cortical regions, which is consistent with the
	hypothesis of abnormal cortical connectivity in autism.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether medial temporal lobe atrophy predicted
	outcome in patients with minor cognitive impairment and whether assessment
	of the medial temporal lobe could increase the predictive accuracy
	of age and delayed recall for outcome. Quantitative and qualitative
	methods of assessing the medial temporal lobe were also compared.
	METHODS: Patients with minor cognitive impairment older than 50 years
	(n=31) were selected from a memory clinic and were followed up for
	on average 1.9 years. The medial temporal lobe was assessed in three
	different ways: volumetry of the hippocampus, volumetry of the parahippocampal
	gyrus, and qualitative rating of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA).
	Outcome measures were Alzheimer type dementia or cognitive decline
	at follow up. Delayed recall was tested with a verbal learning test.
	RESULTS: Ten patients had experienced cognitive decline at follow
	up, of whom seven had probable Alzheimer type dementia. All medial
	temporal lobe measurements were associated with cognitive decline
	at follow up (p trend analysis between 0.001 (hippocampus) and 0.05
	(parahippocampal gyrus)). Only the hippocampal volume and MTA score
	were associated with Alzheimer type dementia at follow up (p trend
	analysis respectively 0.003 and 0.01). All medial temporal lobe measurements
	increased the predictive accuracy of age and the delayed recall score
	for cognitive decline (p increase in predictive accuracy varied between
	<0.001 (hippocampus) and 0.02 (parahippocampal gyrus and MTA score))
	and the hippocampal volume and the MTA score increased the predictive
	accuracy of age and the delayed recall score for Alzheimer type dementia
	(p= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The ability to detect patients at high risk
	for Alzheimer type dementia among those with minor cognitive impairment
	increases when data on age and memory function are combined with
	measures of medial temporal lobe atrophy. Volumetry of the hippocampus
	is preferred, but qualitative rating of medial temporal lobe atrophy
	is a good alternative.},

	Abstract = {Over recent years, high field MR scanners (3 T and above) have become
	increasingly widespread due to potential advantages such as higher
	signal-to-noise ratio. However, few examples of high resolution images
	covering the whole brain in reasonable acquisition times have been
	published to date and none have used fast spin echo (FSE), a sequence
	commonly employed for the acquisition of T(2) weighted images at
	1.5 T. This is mostly due to the increased technical challenges associated
	with uniform signal generation and the increasingly restrictive constraints
	of current safety guidelines at high field. We investigated 10 volunteers
	using an FSE sequence optimized to the 4.7 T environment. This sequence
	allows the acquisition of 17- and 34-slice data sets with an in-plane
	resolution of approximately 500 microm x 500 microm and a slice thickness
	of 2 mm, in 5 min 40 s and 11 min 20 s, respectively. The images
	appear T(2) weighted, although the contrast is due to the combined
	effects of chosen echo time, magnetization transfer, direct radio
	frequency saturation and diffusion as well as the T(1) and T(2) relaxation
	times of the tissue. The result is an excellent detailed visualization
	of anatomical structures, demonstrating the great potential of 4.7
	T MRI for clinical applications. This paper shows that, with careful
	optimization of sequence parameters, FSE imaging can be used at high
	field to generate images with high spatial resolution and uniform
	contrast across the whole brain within the prescribed power deposition
	limits.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allows direct
	visualization and volumetric analysis of the corticospinal tract
	(CST). The purpose of this study was to determine whether color maps
	and fiber tracking derived from DTI data are valuable in detecting
	and quantifying CST degeneration in patients with amyotrophic lateral
	sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: Sixteen patients with ALS with clinical
	signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement and 17 healthy subjects
	were studied with the use of DTI. Disease severity was determined
	by means of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) and
	an UMN involvement score. DTI was acquired with a 12-direction, single-shot,
	spin-echo echo-planar sequence. The CST from the lower pons to the
	corona radiata at the level of the corpus callosum on 4 contiguous
	coronal sections was manually segmented by using color maps generated
	from the DTI data. The left and right CST volumes were measured separately
	and normalized to the total intracranial volume. Normalized CST volumes
	were compared between patients with ALS and healthy subjects. RESULTS:
	The CST volumes of patients with ALS were significantly reduced (P
	< .01, unpaired t test) compared with healthy subjects, in both affected
	and nonaffected hemispheres. No significant correlation was found
	between CST volumes and any of the clinical parameters, including
	disease duration, ALSFRS-R, or UMN involvement score. CONCLUSION:
	This study shows that volumetric analysis by using DTI-based color
	maps is valuable in detecting and monitoring structural degeneration
	of the CST. This will lead to objective and quantitative assessment
	of axonal degeneration in ALS.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To prospectively determine whether diffusion-tensor magnetic
	resonance (MR) imaging in conjunction with two-dimensional chemical
	shift imaging can assist in identifying upper motor neuron involvement
	and whether disease severity and duration can be predicted based
	on imaging parameters in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
	(ALS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval
	and informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study.
	Fifteen patients with ALS (12 men, three women; mean age, 57.3 years)
	with clinical evidence of upper motor neuron involvement and 10 healthy
	control subjects (five men and five women; mean age, 49.4 years)
	were studied. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient
	(ADC) were measured from the corticospinal tracts at the level of
	the internal capsule. Average N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine-phosphocreatine
	(Cr) and NAA/choline-containing compounds (Cho) ratios were calculated
	from the precentral gyrus. Student t test, multiple linear regression
	analysis, and Spearman correlation coefficients were employed to
	quantify relationships between imaging and clinical parameters. RESULTS:
	Patients with ALS exhibited significantly reduced FA values and NAA/Cr
	and NAA/Cho ratios compared with values in control subjects (P<.05)
	for both affected and nonaffected sides of the brain. ADC was elevated
	significantly in the affected side (P<.05) and was an independent
	predictor of disease duration after adjusting for age; however, FA
	values and NAA/Cr ratios for the affected side were even stronger
	predictors of disease duration. Moderate but statistically significant
	correlation was found between the FA values for the affected side
	and the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) score (r=0.51,
	P<.05). The NAA/Cr ratio also correlated with both the ALSFRS-R and
	upper motor neuron scores (r=0.50 and 0.54, respectively; P<.05).
	CONCLUSION: Diffusion-tensor and two-dimensional chemical shift MR
	imaging spectroscopy can be used to identify upper motor neuron involvement

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Most neuroimaging studies of posttraumatic stress disorder
	(PTSD) have focused on potential abnormalities in the whole hippocampus,
	but the subfields of this structure, which have distinctive histological
	characteristics and specialized functions, have not been investigated.
	Studies of individual subfields may clarify the role of the hippocampus
	in PTSD. OBJECTIVE: To determine if PTSD is associated with structural
	alterations in specific subfields of the hippocampus. DESIGN: Case-control
	study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 17 male veterans with combat trauma
	and PTSD (mean [SD] age, 41 [12] years) and 19 age-matched male veterans
	without PTSD who were recruited from the outpatient mental health
	clinic of the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center and by
	advertising in the community. INTERVENTIONS: High-resolution magnetic
	resonance imaging at 4 T. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Volumes of hippocampal
	subfields. RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress disorder was associated
	with 11.4\% (1.5\%) (P = .02) smaller mean (SD) cornu ammonis 3 (CA3)/dentate
	gyrus subfield volumes, irrespective of age-related alterations,
	whereas other subfields were spared. Age was associated with reduced
	volume of the CA1 subfield (P = .03). Total hippocampal volume was
	also reduced in PTSD by a mean (SD) of 6.5\% (0.6\%) but, related
	to both PTSD (P = .05) and age (P = .01), was consistent with the
	measurements in the subfields. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate
	for the first time in humans that PTSD is associated with selective
	volume loss of the CA3/dentate gyrus subfields, consistent with animal
	studies, implying that chronic stress suppresses neurogenesis and
	dendritic branching in these structures.},

	Abstract = {Characterizing the performance of image segmentation approaches has
	been a persistent challenge. Performance analysis is important since
	segmentation algorithms often have limited accuracy and precision.
	Interactive drawing of the desired segmentation by human raters has
	often been the only acceptable approach, and yet suffers from intra-rater
	and inter-rater variability. Automated algorithms have been sought
	in order to remove the variability introduced by raters, but such
	algorithms must be assessed to ensure they are suitable for the task.
	The performance of raters (human or algorithmic) generating segmentations
	of medical images has been difficult to quantify because of the difficulty
	of obtaining or estimating a known true segmentation for clinical
	data. Although physical and digital phantoms can be constructed for
	which ground truth is known or readily estimated, such phantoms do
	not fully reflect clinical images due to the difficulty of constructing
	phantoms which reproduce the full range of imaging characteristics
	and normal and pathological anatomical variability observed in clinical
	data. Comparison to a collection of segmentations by raters is an
	attractive alternative since it can be carried out directly on the
	relevant clinical imaging data. However, the most appropriate measure
	or set of measures with which to compare such segmentations has not
	been clarified and several measures are used in practice. We present
	here an expectation-maximization algorithm for simultaneous truth
	and performance level estimation (STAPLE). The algorithm considers
	a collection of segmentations and computes a probabilistic estimate
	of the true segmentation and a measure of the performance level represented
	by each segmentation. The source of each segmentation in the collection
	may be an appropriately trained human rater or raters, or may be
	an automated segmentation algorithm. The probabilistic estimate of
	the true segmentation is formed by estimating an optimal combination
	of the segmentations, weighting each segmentation depending upon
	the estimated performance level, and incorporating a prior model
	for the spatial distribution of structures being segmented as well
	as spatial homogeneity constraints. STAPLE is straightforward to
	apply to clinical imaging data, it readily enables assessment of
	the performance of an automated image segmentation algorithm, and
	enables direct comparison of human rater and algorithm performance.},

	In our derivation of the registration procedure, few assumptions

	AD subjects (10 ml/year). The rate of ventricular expansion accelerated
	over time. At the point when each subject had a Clinical Dementia

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized trials of surgery for epilepsy have not been
	conducted, because of the difficulties involved in designing and
	implementing feasible studies. The lack of data supporting the therapeutic
	usefulness of surgery precludes making strong recommendations for
	patients with epilepsy. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial
	to assess the efficacy and safety of surgery for temporal-lobe epilepsy.
	METHODS: Eighty patients with temporal-lobe epilepsy were randomly
	assigned to surgery (40 patients) or treatment with antiepileptic
	drugs for one year (40 patients). Optimal medical therapy and primary
	outcomes were assessed by epileptologists who were unaware of the
	patients' treatment assignments. The primary outcome was freedom
	from seizures that impair awareness of self and surroundings. Secondary
	outcomes were the frequency and severity of seizures, the quality
	of life, disability, and death. RESULTS: At one year, the cumulative
	proportion of patients who were free of seizures impairing awareness
	was 58 percent in the surgical group and 8 percent in the medical
	group (P<0.001). The patients in the surgical group had fewer seizures
	impairing awareness and a significantly better quality of life (P<0.001
	for both comparisons) than the patients in the medical group. Four
	patients (10 percent) had adverse effects of surgery. One patient
	in the medical group died. CONCLUSIONS: In temporal-lobe epilepsy,
	surgery is superior to prolonged medical therapy. Randomized trials
	of surgery for epilepsy are feasible and appear to yield precise
	estimates of treatment effects.},

	Abstract = {The midsagittal area of the corpus callosum was measured in its entirety
	and in seven subdivisions in a sample of 50 brains consecutively
	obtained from autopsies of individuals who had neuropsychological
	testing before death. A 12-item test of hand preference was used
	as an index of the pattern of interhemispheric functional asymmetry.
	Callosal size was analysed for two factors: hand preference, classified
	as consistent-right-hand preference (CRH) versus non consistent-right-hand
	preference, and sex. The group of nCRH (n = 18) was found to have
	a larger overall callosal area, with the greatest difference occurring
	in the posterior body segments, especially the isthmus. The isthmus
	probably includes interhemispheric fibres from posterior parietal
	and superior temporal cortex which involves cortical regions related
	to functional asymmetry. The results of variation in callosal morphology
	are discussed as part of a possible substrate of functional asymmetry
	and due to variation in axonal elimination in early brain development.
	Sex differences were found in several aspects of callosal anatomy.
	(1) The difference between hand groups in the posterior body occurred
	in interaction with sex:handedness was a factor in callosal size
	in males (n = 15), but not in females (n = 35). This result is consistent
	with the general hypothesis of females having less clear lateralization
	than males. (2) Females did not have a larger overall callosum or
	a larger splenium, either in absolute size or size proportional to
	brain weight. The latter measure was considered since callosal area
	correlated with cerebrum weight (r = 0.48). In contrast, female of
	both hand groups were found to have a larger proportional isthmus
	compared to CRH males. (3) Of all callosal regions, only the genu

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Interictal hypometabolism has lateralizing
	value in cases of temporal lobe epilepsy and positive predictive
	value for seizure-free outcome after surgery to treat epilepsy. Alterations
	in regional cerebral metabolism can also be inferred from measurements
	of regional cerebral perfusion. The purpose of this study was to
	determine the feasibility of detecting cerebral blood flow (CBF)
	asymmetries in the mesial temporal lobes using continuous arterial
	spin labeling perfusion MR imaging, which is a noninvasive method
	for calculating regional CBF. METHODS: Twelve patients with medically
	refractory temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent preoperative evaluation
	for temporal lobectomy and 12 normal control participants were studied
	retrospectively. Absolute and normalized mesial temporal CBF measurements
	were compared between the patient and control groups. Lateralization
	based on a perfusion asymmetry index was compared with metabolic
	((18)[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) and hippocampal
	volumetric asymmetry indices and with clinical lateralization. RESULTS:
	Mesial temporal CBF was more asymmetric in patients with temporal
	lobe epilepsy than in normal control participants, although asymmetric
	mesial temporal CBF was also found in normal participants, with the
	left side dominant. Ipsilateral mesial temporal CBF was significantly
	decreased compared with contralateral mesial temporal CBF in patients
	with temporal lobe epilepsy. Global CBF measurements were significantly
	decreased in patients compared with control participants. Asymmetry
	in mesial temporal blood flow in patients persisted after normalization
	to global CBF. Lateralization using continuous arterial spin labeling
	perfusion MR imaging asymmetry index significantly correlated with
	lateralization based on (18)[F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
	tomography hypometabolism, hippocampal volumes, and clinical evaluation.
	CONCLUSION: Continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion MR imaging
	can detect interictal asymmetries in mesial temporal lobe perfusion
	in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. This technique is readily
	combined with routine structural assessment and potentially offers
	an inexpensive and noninvasive means of screening for asymmetries
	in interictal mesial temporal lobe function.},

	and 29 controls) to assess inter-hemispheric facilitation and interference
	of colour naming. In the larger sample (total subjects, n = 85),
	there were no significant differences between patients and controls
	in CC area but a trend towards smaller values in patients in all
	but the posterior segment. In the sub-sample, bilateral facilitation
	was greater, and interference, less in schizophrenics compared with
	controls. There was a positive correlation between facilitation and
	posterior CC area, parallelled by a negative correlation between
	interference and posterior CC area, in both patients and controls,
	which only reached statistical significance when both groups were
	combined. These findings suggest that the link, between CC size and
	neuropsychological processes involving inter-hemispheric transfer
	of information, is common to both schizophrenics and normal controls.
	There were significant negative correlations between anterior CC
	area and psychomotor poverty (avolition, anhedonia and affective
	flattening), and a suggestion that the negative correlation between
	age and CC size in controls was not present in patients.},

	method (AIR 3.0) based on matching of voxel intensities. METHOD:
	Different cost functions, different minimization methods, and various
	sampling, smoothing, and editing strategies were compared. Internal
	consistency measures were used to place limits on registration accuracy
	for MRI data, and absolute accuracy was measured using a brain phantom
	for PET data. RESULTS: All strategies were consistent with subvoxel
	accuracy for intrasubject, intramodality registration. Estimated
	accuracy of registration of structural MRI images was in the 75 to
	150 microns range. Sparse data sampling strategies reduced registration
	times to minutes with only modest loss of accuracy. CONCLUSION: The
	registration algorithm described is a robust and flexible tool that
	can be used to address a variety of image registration problems.
	Registration strategies can be tailored to meet different needs by
	optimizing tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.},

	(e.g., PET-to-PET) image alignment. We now describe modifications
	to this method that allow for cross-modality registration of MRI
	and PET brain images obtained from a single subject. METHODS: This
	method does not require fiducial markers and the user is not required
	to identify common structures on the two image sets. To align the
	images, the algorithm seeks to minimize the standard deviation of
	the PET pixel values that correspond to each MRI pixel value. The
	MR images must be edited to exclude nonbrain regions prior to using
	the algorithm. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The method has been validated
	quantitatively using data from patients with stereotaxic fiducial
	markers rigidly fixed in the skull. Maximal three-dimensional errors
	of < 3 mm and mean three-dimensional errors of < 2 mm were measured.
	Computation time on a SPARCstation IPX varies from 3 to 9 min to
	align MR image sets with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET images. The
	MR alignment with noisy H2(15)O PET images typically requires 20-30

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have observed
	hyperactivity in the hippocampal region in individuals with Mild
	Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, the actual source of such hyperactivity
	is not well understood. Studies of aged rats observed similar hyperactive
	signals in the CA3 region of the hippocampus that correlated with
	spatial memory deficits and, in particular, with their ability to
	represent novel environments as being distinct from familiar ones
	(pattern separation). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that
	patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) have deficits in pattern separation,
	along with hyperactive fMRI BOLD activity in the CA3 region of the
	hippocampus. We used high-resolution fMRI during a continuous recognition
	task designed to emphasize pattern separation. We conducted hippocampal
	subfield-level region of interest analyses to test for dysfunctional
	activity in aMCI patients. We found that patients showed impaired
	performance on trials that taxed their pattern separation abilities.
	We also observed hyperactive BOLD signals in the CA3/dentate and
	hypoactive signals in the entorhinal cortex during the separation
	condition. In a high-resolution morphometric analysis of hippocampal
	subfields, aMCI patients also had smaller CA3/dentate and CA1 volumes
	(no difference in the subiculum). The CA3/dentate region bilaterally
	also exhibited the largest shape deformations in aMCI patients, suggesting
	that this locus is affected early in the course of the disease. These
	findings suggest that structural and functional changes in the CA3/dentate
	region of the hippocampus contribute to the deficits in episodic
	memory that are observed in patients with aMCI. The functional hyperactivity
	may be evidence for a dysfunctional encoding mechanism, consistent
	with the predictions of computational models of hippocampal learning.},

	analysis in fMRI studies. The method restricts anatomical normalization,
	spatial smoothing and random effects statistical analysis to the

	finding intersubject correspondences between manually outlined masks,
	and it leverages the continuous medial representation, which makes
	it possible to extend surface-based shape correspondences to the
	space inside and outside of structures. Our approach is an alternative
	to whole-brain normalization in cases where the latter may fail due
	to anatomical variability or pathology. It also provides an opportunity
	to analyze the shape and thickness of structures concurrently with
	functional activation. We apply the technique to the hippocampus
	and evaluate it using data from a visual scene encoding fMRI study,
	where activation in the hippocampus is expected. We produce detailed
	statistical maps of hippocampal activation, as well as maps comparing
	activation inside and outside of the hippocampus. We find that random

	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We study morphologic characteristics and
	age-related changes in patients with schizophrenia to investigate
	whether abnormal neurodevelopment and brain structure have a role
	in the pathophysiological course of this disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
	Our data consist of a set of cranial magnetic resonance images of
	46 patients with schizophrenia and age- and sex-matched healthy controls.
	We deformed a template brain image to our set of subject images.
	Jacobian fields of these deformations were reduced to sets of 52
	normalized region volumes for each subject by using a neuroanatomic
	atlas. Normalized regional volumes of the control and patient groups
	were compared by using Student t-test, and age correlation of each
	region volume was calculated for the two groups. All results were
	corrected for multiple comparisons by using permutation testing.
	We used a classifier based on support vector machines and a feature
	selection method to determine our ability to discriminate brains
	of controls from those of patients. RESULTS: Analysis of normalized
	region volumes shows enlargement of the third ventricle in patients.
	The age-correlation study showed a significant positive correlation
	in the third ventricle and right thalamus of controls, but not patients.
	Using an average of 6.5 features, our classifier was able to correctly
	identify 72\% of patients and 70\% of controls. CONCLUSION: In addition
	to enlargement of the third ventricle, brains of patients with schizophrenia
	show a different pattern of age-related changes.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new shape representation for a special class
	of 3-D objects. In a generative approach to object modeling inspired
	by m-reps, skeletons of objects are explicitly defined as continuous
	manifolds and boundaries are derived from the skeleton by a process
	that involves solving a Poisson PDE with a non-linear boundary condition.
	This formulation helps satisfy the equality constraints that are
	imposed on the parameters of the representation by rules of medial
	geometry. One benefit of the new approach is the ability to represent
	different instances of an anatomical structure using a common parametrization
	domain, simplifying the problem of computing correspondences between
	instances. Another benefit is the ability to continuously parameterize
	the volumetric region enclosed by the representation's boundary in
	a one-to-one and onto manner, in a way that preserves two of the
	three coordinates of the parametrization along vectors normal to
	the boundary. These two features make the new representation an attractive
	candidate for statistical analysis of shape and appearance. In this
	paper, the representation is carefully defined and the results of
	fitting the hippocampus in a deformable templates framework are presented.},

	The framework takes advantage of the fact that several of the major

	The medial representation makes it possible to average and combine

	Abstract = {Spatial normalization of diffusion tensor images plays a key role
	in voxel-based analysis of white matter (WM) group differences. Currently,
	it has been achieved using low-dimensional registration methods in
	the large majority of clinical studies. This paper aims to motivate
	the use of high-dimensional normalization approaches by generating
	evidence of their impact on the findings of such studies. Using an
	ongoing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) study, we evaluated three
	normalization methods representing the current range of available
	approaches: low-dimensional normalization using the fractional anisotropy
	(FA), high-dimensional normalization using the FA, and high-dimensional
	normalization using full tensor information. Each method was assessed
	in terms of its ability to detect significant differences between
	ALS patients and controls. Our findings suggest that inadequate normalization
	with low-dimensional approaches can result in insufficient removal
	of shape differences which in turn can confound FA differences in
	a complex manner, and that utilizing high-dimensional normalization
	can both significantly minimize the confounding effect of shape differences
	to FA differences and provide a more complete description of WM differences
	in terms of both size and tissue architecture differences. We also
	found that high-dimensional approaches, by leveraging full tensor
	features instead of tensor-derived indices, can further improve the
	alignment of WM tracts.},

	Abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging plays a key role in our understanding of
	white matter both in normal populations and in populations with brain
	disorders. Existing techniques focus primarily on using diffusivity-based
	quantities derived from diffusion tensor as surrogate measures of
	microstructural tissue properties of white matter. In this paper,
	we describe a novel tract-specific framework that enables the examination
	of white matter morphometry at both the macroscopic and microscopic
	scales. The framework leverages the skeleton-based modeling of sheet-like
	white matter fasciculi using the continuous medial representation,
	which gives a natural definition of thickness and supports its comparison
	across subjects. The thickness measure provides a macroscopic characterization
	of white matter fasciculi that complements existing analysis of microstructural
	features. The utility of the framework is demonstrated in quantifying
	white matter atrophy in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a severe neurodegenerative
	disease of motor neurons. We show that, compared to using microscopic
	features alone, combining the macroscopic and microscopic features
	gives a more complete characterization of the disease.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel deformable registration algorithm
	for diffusion tensor MR images that enables explicit optimization
	of tensor reorientation. The optimization seeks a piecewise affine
	transformation that divides the image domain into uniform regions
	and transform each region affinely. The objective function captures
	both the image similarity and the smoothness of the transformation
	across region boundaries. The image similarity enables explicit orientation
	optimization by incorporating tensor reorientation, which is necessary
	for warping diffusion tensor images. The objective function is formulated
	in a way that allows explicit implementation of analytic derivatives
	to drive fast and accurate optimization using the conjugate gradient
	method. By explicitly optimizing tensor reorientation, the algorithm
	is designed to take advantage of similarity measures comparing tensors
	as a whole. The optimal transformation is hierarchically refined
	in a subdivision framework. A comparison with affine registration
	for inter-subject normalization of 8 subjects shows that the proposed
	algorithm improves the alignment of several major white matter structures
	examined: the anterior thalamic radiations, the inferior fronto-occipital
	fasciculi, the corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts and the genu and
	the splenium of the corpus callosum. The alignment of white matter
	structures is assessed using a novel scheme of computing distances
	between the corresponding fiber bundles derived from tractography.},

	Abstract = {The difficulty of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to support
	early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) stems from the subtle
	pathological changes in the central nervous system (CNS). In this
	study, texture analysis was performed on MR images of MS patients
	and normal controls and a combined set of texture features were explored
	in order to better discriminate tissues between MS lesions, normal
	appearing white matter (NAWM) and normal white matter (NWM). Features
	were extracted from gradient matrix, run-length (RL) matrix, gray
	level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), autoregressive (AR) model and
	wavelet analysis, and were selected based on greatest difference
	between different tissue types. The results of the combined set of
	texture features were compared with our previous results of GLCM-based
	features alone. The results of this study demonstrated that (1) with
	the combined set of texture features, classification was perfect
	(100\%) between MS lesions and NAWM (or NWM), less successful (88.89\%)
	among the three tissue types and worst (58.33\%) between NAWM and
	NWM; (2) compared with GLCM-based features, the combined set of texture
	features were better at discriminating MS lesions and NWM, equally
	good at discriminating MS lesions and NAWM and at all three tissue
	types, but less effective in classification between NAWM and NWM.
	This study suggested that texture analysis with the combined set
	of texture features may be equally good or more advantageous than
	the commonly used GLCM-based features alone in discriminating MS
	lesions and NWM/NAWM and in supporting early diagnosis of MS.},

@article{zhang01,
	Abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for
	statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images
	because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant
	nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based
	model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information
	is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined
	images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not
	the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias
	field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods
	produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden
	Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated
	by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which
	can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically,
	it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the
	HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way
	in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences
	of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in
	MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods
	are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based
	approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show
	that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into
	a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved.
	More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with
	other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction
	algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into
	this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach
	for brain MR image segmentation.},
